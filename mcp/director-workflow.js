//
//   Spec refs:
//     - R2.1: a single `knowgrph.video_remix.run` tool accepting
//       `{ referenceUrl, brief, budgetUsd, mode, approvals[] }` and returning
//       a Run_Manifest.
//     - R4.1: strict stage ordering. Task 2.1 ESTABLISHED the ordering as the
//       workflow skeleton's source of truth; task 2.2 implements the DETAILED
//       enforcement here (begin each stage only after the prior reaches
//       `completed`) via the strict stage-ordering state machine
//       (`enforceStrictStageOrdering` / `checkStrictStageOrdering`).
//     - Design Property 7 (stage ordering invariant): the observed stage start
//       sequence is a prefix of research -> storyboard -> render -> publish ->
//       checkout, and no stage begins before its predecessor completes.
//     - Design refs: "Components and Interfaces > Director Orchestrator" and
//       "Work Flow > Director run as a durable AgentWorkflow".
//
// REUSE-NOT-REBUILD: this module does NOT re-implement the planner, gates,
// failure handling, or stage logic. It models the Director as an Agents SDK
// `AgentWorkflow`-shaped skeleton that WRAPS the existing
// `runVideoRemix(...)` composition (`mcp/video-remix-runtime.js`) and WIRES the
// four builders (`buildPlanner`, `buildToolCalls`, `buildApprovalGates`,
// `buildFailureHandling`) exported from `mcp/director-lanes.js`. Each
// workflow step exposes a clean seam (`DIRECTOR_SEAMS`) where the detailed
// behaviors implemented in spec tasks 2.2-2.16 plug in.
//
// PURE-JS / SDK-AGNOSTIC: like the Section-1 `tool-registry.mjs`, this is a
// pure-JS module so it is consumable by both the Cloudflare Worker
// (`cloudflare/workers/knowgrph-mcp/`) and Node `node:test` units without
// booting workerd. The Agents SDK `AgentWorkflow` class (which requires the
// Workers runtime) can later adopt this descriptor in `index.ts`; the workflow
// SHAPE (ordered steps + run entrypoint + stage-ordering invariant) lives here
// so it stays verifiable under Node.
