// Health-route retry/record layer for Demo_Pack assembly
// (knowgrph-acos-mcp-connector spec, task 2.16 — R3.4, R3.5).
//
// R3.4: WHEN the product is deployed and the deploy Approval_Gates are
//   approved, THE Agent_Api SHALL return HTTP 200 on its `GET /health` route
//   within 5 seconds.
// R3.5: IF `GET /health` does not return HTTP 200 within 5 seconds after the
//   deploy Approval_Gates are approved, THEN THE Director SHALL retry the
//   request up to 3 times and, if all retries fail, record a health-check
//   failure indication in the Demo_Pack.
//
// PURE and TIMER-FREE, exactly like the 2.14 reachability marking: this layer
// NEVER opens a socket and NEVER sleeps. It accepts an INJECTABLE sequence (or
// function) of health-probe attempt RESULTS, so a unit test needs no network
// and no real 5s timer. The live probe (an HTTP GET with a 5s deadline) is
// wired in integration task 9.2 and passed in here as `attempts`.
//
// Trigger rule: the probe runs ONLY after the deploy Approval_Gate(s) are
// approved (R3.4 — "WHEN ... the deploy Approval_Gates are approved"). Before
// approval — or when no probe is injected (the runtime default, no real network
// call) — no attempt is made and no failure is recorded.
