// Bounded-retry failure-handling model (spec task 2.6 / R5.1, R5.2, R5.3 /
// Property 8 — partial; the fail-closed-on-exhaustion half is task 2.7).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is a DETERMINISTIC, PURE model of the Director's bounded-retry policy.
// It NEVER sleeps — it maps an attempt index to the backoff delay that a real
// scheduler WOULD wait, so the policy is unit/property testable without timers.
//
//   * R5.1: exponential backoff starting at 1s, doubling each attempt, capped
//     at 30s per attempt; `retryCount` increments by exactly 1 per attempt.
//   * R5.2: total iterations are bounded by `maxIterations`, a positive integer
//     in [1,100]. This range is reconciled with the Section-1 worker schemas
//     (`cloudflare/workers/knowgrph-mcp/index.ts` Zod `.int().min(1).max(100)`
//     and `tool-registry.mjs` JSON Schema `minimum:1, maximum:100`), which
//     already accept [1,100]. The runtime previously clamped maxIterations to
//     [1,12] via `normalizeCount`; `normalizeMaxIterations` below widens it to
//     [1,100] so the runtime and the MCP boundary agree on the accepted space.
//   * R5.3: WHILE `retryCount < maxIterations`, Run_State stays `running`.
//
// SEAM (task 2.7): when `retryCount` reaches `maxIterations` the run fails
// closed — Run_State becomes `blocked` and a failure record
// `{ stageId, finalRetryCount, reason }` is appended. That transition is NOT
// implemented here; this model only surfaces the `exhausted` run-state marker
// so task 2.7 can map it to `blocked` + the failure record.

// Budget-cap enforcement (spec task 2.9 / R4.6 / Property 9).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// R4.6: WHEN cumulative Budget_Meters spend reaches or exceeds the configured
// budget cap mid-run, THE Director SHALL record `budget_exceeded`, halt all
// further spend-bearing stages, and surface a budget-exceeded indication to the
// operator.
//
// `budget_exceeded` is its OWN terminal Run_State (the design Run_State enum is
// `running | blocked | budget_exceeded | approval_required | verification_failed
// | completed`). It is distinct from the `blocked` causes (weak-signal,
// provider-unavailability, retry-exhaustion): those halt the run for a
// degraded/failed reason, whereas `budget_exceeded` halts because the spend cap
// was reached. The Section-1 McpAgent Director output schema treats `state` as a
// permissive string (`z.string().optional()` in `index.ts`; `{ type: "string" }`
// in `tool-registry.mjs`), so the new state passes through with no schema change.
//
// Enforcement is DETERMINISTIC and timer-free. Cumulative spend is driven by an
// injectable signal (`simulatedSpendUsd`) so a test can push cumulative spend to
// or past the cap WITHOUT any real provider call; in production it is the same
// derived spend the Budget_Meters already track (provider spend + model spend).
