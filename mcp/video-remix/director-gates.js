// Director-layer Approval_Gate enforcement wiring for the video-remix runtime
// (knowgrph-acos-mcp-connector spec, task 4.5 / R4.2, R4.3, R9.3 /
// Correctness Property 1 + Property 17).
//
// Responsibility (single): thread the issued Approval_Token through the render
// and checkout/payout spend boundaries at the DIRECTOR orchestration layer, own
// single-use CONSUMPTION on a permitted use, and RECORD a rejection (reason +
// canonical error) into the Run_Manifest while leaving spend-bearing state
// unchanged. This is the orchestration-layer coherence piece that sits on top
// of the already-implemented Hitl_Gate_Service pieces:
//   * issuance + storage + single-use seam  -> approval-token-issuer.js
//   * verify-immediately-before-spend guard  -> approval-gate-guard.js
//   * the shared spend-boundary predicate    -> gate-token.js / render-token.js
//
// AVOID DOUBLE-VERIFICATION DRIFT (task 4.5 directive): the render harness
// (`runRenderHarness`) verifies `renderGateToken` internally and the commerce
// harness (`runCheckout`) verifies `paymentGateToken` internally — that harness
// check is the SINGLE spend-boundary verification. This module therefore does
// NOT re-run `verifyGateToken` (which would be a second, potentially divergent
// check). Instead it READS the harness's own permitted/rejected outcome and:
//   * on a PERMITTED use -> applies the issuer's single-use consume seam
//     strictly AFTER the spend so a second use of the same token fails closed
//     (R11.8 / Property 1) and attaches the harness result to the manifest;
//   * on a REJECTED use  -> records the rejection reason + canonical error and
//     preserves the prior Run_State and all spend-bearing state, performing no
//     consumption (a rejected token is never consumed) (R4.8 / R9.3 / R11.7).
//
// Pure / SDK-agnostic apart from the injected harness seams: importable by both
// the Node tests and the Cloudflare Worker bundle. The clock (`now`) and every
// provider client flow through the harness `deps`, so the local runtime makes
// ZERO live network calls.
