// Weak-signal halt-before-storyboard gate for the video-remix Director runtime
// (knowgrph-acos-mcp-connector spec, task 3.4 / R4.5, R6.5 / Property 11 —
// the Director HALT side).
//
// Responsibility (single): given the research Source_Card count, decide whether
// the Director must HALT before the storyboard stage because research came back
// with fewer than the required minimum (a `weak_signal`), and expose an
// observable "awaiting approval to continue past weak signal" indication. The
// halt is LIFTED only when a verified continuation Approval_Token is supplied.
//
// Boundary / reuse notes (do not overstep adjacent tasks):
//   * The Research_Harness (task 3.3) already marks its envelope `weak_signal`
//     and NEVER fabricates sources. This module is purely the Director-side
//     halt decision over the resulting (genuine, sub-minimum) source count —
//     it never adds sources and never re-derives evidence.
//   * The continuation approval is modeled as an INJECTABLE input (a boolean or
//     a `{ verified, gateId }` token), NOT a real wait/timer, so the halt and
//     its release are deterministic and unit/property testable. Live wiring of
//     a real Approval_Token through the Hitl_Gate_Service is Section 4.
//   * Strict ordering (task 2.2) is honored: while halted, the storyboard and
//     every downstream stage must NOT begin (executed === false).
//
// Pure / SDK-agnostic: importable by both the Node tests and the Cloudflare
// Worker bundle.

// Continuation gate id authorizing a run to proceed PAST a weak-signal research
// stage. Kept distinct from the spend-boundary gate ids so the override is
// observable as its own, explicit operator decision (R4.5).
