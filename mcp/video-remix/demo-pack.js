// Demo_Pack builder for the video-remix Director runtime (spec task 2.13 /
// R3.1, R3.2 / Property 22). Extends the verbatim extraction from
// `mcp/video-remix-runtime.js` (reuse-not-rebuild): the existing builder only
// emitted `DEMO_SECTIONS` status markers + caller-supplied urls. This version
// assembles, at a TERMINAL Run_State, exactly seven NON-EMPTY evidence sections
// (one per judging dimension) and a `urls[]` collection that always carries at
// least one Frontend URL and at least one Agent_Api endpoint.
//
// Scope of task 2.13 is the seven-sections + required-urls ASSEMBLY. Task 2.14
// (R3.3 / Property 23) adds URL reachability marking via an INJECTABLE probe
// result set (see `markReachability` below): a url confirmed to return HTTP 200
// within 5s is flipped `reachable:true` and its backing section to
// `verified:true`; any url that did not return 200 within 5s leaves its section
// `verified:false` and records the failing url (on the section and in
// `demoPack.failingUrls[]`). The runtime performs NO real network call — the
// live probe is wired in integration task 9.2 / health task 2.16.
//
// Task 2.15 (R3.6, R3.7 / Property 23, artifact half) adds artifact-reference
// completeness via `buildArtifactReferences` + `markArtifactCompleteness`
// (see below): each of the three artifacts — Evidence_Pack citations, the
// rendered asset reference (assetUrl / ledgerEventId), and the Stripe checkout
// session id — is REFERENCED when it exists and explicitly marked "not
// available" when it does not, surfaced as `demoPack.artifactReferences` and
// reflected in the backing section's evidence + `verified`. It composes with
// the 2.14 reachability half: a section that is BOTH url-backed and
// artifact-backed (the judge-facing `demo_presentation` dimension) is verified
// only when its url is reachable AND its artifact is present.
//
// Task 2.16 (R3.4, R3.5) adds the health-route retry/record layer via
// `runHealthCheck` (imported from `./health-check.js`): after the deploy
// Approval_Gate(s) are approved, an INJECTABLE sequence of `GET /health` probe
// attempts is retried up to 3 times when an attempt does not return HTTP 200
// within 5s; if all attempts fail, a distinct health-check failure indication
// is recorded as `demoPack.healthCheck = { url, probed, attempts, passed,
// failureRecorded }`. Like the 2.14 reachability marking it is PURE and
// TIMER-FREE (no socket, no sleep); the live probe is wired in integration
// task 9.2. It is consistent with the 2.14 `agent-api-health` url.
