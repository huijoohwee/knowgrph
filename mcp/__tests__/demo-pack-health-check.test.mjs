// Unit tests for the Demo_Pack health-route retry/record layer
// (knowgrph-acos-mcp-connector spec, task 2.16 — R3.4, R3.5).
//
// R3.4: after the deploy Approval_Gate(s) are approved, `GET /health` returns
//   HTTP 200 within 5s.
// R3.5: if it does not return 200 within 5s, retry up to 3 times and, if all
//   retries fail, record a health-check failure indication in the Demo_Pack.
//
// These tests inject the health-probe attempt RESULTS (no network, no real 5s
// timer). They assert:
//   * health passes on attempt 1 (no retries needed),
//   * health passes on a later retry within the 3-attempt budget,
//   * all 3 attempts fail -> a distinct failure indication is recorded,
//   * the deploy gate is not approved -> no probe is attempted.
