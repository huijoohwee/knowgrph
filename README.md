# Knowgrph

**The frontmatter is the program. Git is the audit trail. There is no export step.**

Knowgrph is a markdown file that runs. Its YAML frontmatter is a typed widget graph — nodes are **widgets** (input, compute, rich-media panels), edges are typed **sockets** — and that same file is the thing an LLM/MCP agent (or a human) can **run, gate, persist, and replay**. Not a board that exports to markdown. Not a database that a canvas renders. The `.md` file committed to git *is* the graph, the audit trail, and the runnable program, all at once, with nothing else underneath it.

The same file is three things at once:

- a **human-readable Markdown doc** (read it in any editor or on the web),
- a **typed widget graph** (`kgc-computing-flow/v1` frontmatter — nodes, edges, sockets, run actions), and
- a **runnable agent program** (compute nodes, approval gates, budget meters, and media outputs that an LLM/MCP agent can execute end to end).

Knowgrph is provider-neutral and project-agnostic: it operates on any brief, canvas graph, tool schema, or media provider without assuming a particular vendor, document, or domain. If you're looking for "agentic canvas" in the broader sense — Miro, tldraw, and others now use that phrase too, and worth knowing about (see below) — the claim above is the narrower, specific one only Knowgrph makes: the canvas has no format underneath it other than the markdown file itself.

## Why Knowgrph exists

Most agent frameworks separate "the agent's memory" from "the knowledge the human actually owns." That split creates two problems:

- **Vendor lock-in on state**: an agent's reasoning trail lives in a proprietary checkpointer or scene format you can't easily inspect, diff, or version.
- **Knowledge that agents can't operate on**: docs, notes, and diagrams sit in formats agents can read but not meaningfully edit, run, or extend.

Knowgrph closes that gap with **KGC (Knowledge Graph Canvas) markdown** — computing-flow-style KTV (`{key, type, value}`) frontmatter rows for graph-level fields, nodes, and widget metadata, with `flow.edges[]` as explicit, source-owned socket links. A plain markdown file *is* the graph, the audit trail, the human-readable doc, and the runnable program, all at once. Git is the provenance layer, for free.

> If you've used LangGraph, AutoGPT, or a Notion/Obsidian-style knowledge base and wished they were the same system — this is aimed at that gap.

## Where Knowgrph sits

Infinite-canvas and agent tools split roughly into a few tiers today:

- **Drawing surfaces** — Excalidraw, tldraw, FigJam. The canvas stores shapes and strokes; it doesn't understand them.
- **Collaboration surfaces adding agents** — Miro's 2026 Canvas update is the most direct validation that this space is real: it added Mermaid/Markdown/HTML widget formats specifically so agents can write to the board "natively," plus MCP support to pull Markdown from a codebase onto the canvas and push decisions back. Markdown is still an *import/export format* for a proprietary, cloud-hosted board underneath — not the board's source of truth.
- **Knowledge surfaces** — Obsidian Canvas and similar. Cards are real notes, but the canvas layout (JSON Canvas) is a sidecar file separate from the notes themselves.
- **Thinking surfaces** — Storyflow-style tools, where an AI reads the whole board as context. Closer to Knowgrph in spirit, but cloud-hosted with proprietary storage.
- **Orchestration libraries** — LangGraph. No canvas at all; state lives in a checkpointer, not a plain file.
- **Self-improving agent runtimes** — Hermes Agent (Nous Research). No canvas at all either, but a genuinely self-evolving skill loop — the real version of a claim easy to overstate elsewhere.

**Knowgrph's difference is structural, not cosmetic**: there is no board format, sidecar file, checkpointer, or database underneath the markdown at all. The `.md` file *is* the node/edge data, the audit trail, and the thing an agent reads, runs, and rewrites. It's also a claim the others can't simply bolt on — Miro's board format is the product it sells; Obsidian's canvas-as-sidecar keeps the note format stable across renderers; LangGraph's checkpointer is intentionally pluggable and storage-agnostic. Making markdown-frontmatter the sole runtime state is an architectural bet made from the start.

| | Knowgrph | Miro Canvas (2026) | Excalidraw / tldraw | Obsidian Canvas | Storyflow-style thinking canvas | LangGraph (raw) | Hermes Agent (Nous Research) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary category** | Runnable knowledge-graph canvas | Commercial collaboration whiteboard | Drawing/sketching surface | Personal-knowledge canvas plugin | Cloud "thinking surface" canvas | Agent orchestration library | Self-improving personal agent runtime |
| **Canvas/graph surface** | ✅ native, typed widget graph | ✅ primary product (agent-generated widgets) | ✅ primary (shapes/strokes only) | ✅ JSON Canvas sidecar | ✅ AI reads board as structured cards | Partial (Studio debug/trace view, not authoring) | ❌ none (chat/messaging + dashboard) |
| **Markdown/frontmatter *is* the runtime state** | ✅ | ❌ (import/export only) | ❌ (JSON canvas format) | Partial (notes yes; layout is a separate sidecar) | ❌ (cloud/proprietary) | ❌ (checkpointer) | ❌ (its own skills/memory store) |
| **State is git-diffable** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Partial (notes only) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Nodes/widgets are runnable** (compute, gate, persist, replay) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Partial | ✅ (state only, no canvas) | N/A (task loop, no graph nodes) |
| **Orchestration model** | LangGraph `StateGraph` (via DeerFlow v2) over KGC markdown SSOT | None (human-driven) | None | None | AI reasons over board context | Multi-node `StateGraph` — the library's core value prop | Single agent loop + skill retrieval |
| **Genuinely self-evolving?** | **No** — scoped; `probe.evolve` evolves one conversation branch, not the agent's own code | No | No | No | No | No | **Yes** — real skill-creation/refinement loop, its core differentiator |
| **License / openness** | FOSS, provider-neutral, project-agnostic | Proprietary, cloud SaaS | FOSS (Excalidraw MIT; tldraw core FOSS) | Core proprietary; Canvas format is open JSON Canvas spec | Proprietary | MIT/Apache (LangChain org) | MIT, self-hosted |
| **Deployment model** | Local-first Dev repo; optional Cloudflare mirror; shipped local stdio + public/control-plane MCP endpoints | Cloud SaaS | Self-hostable / embeddable SDK | Local-first desktop app | Cloud-only | Embedded library in your own app/infra | Self-hosted, multi-platform messaging gateway |
| **Best fit** | The document itself should be the agent-runnable, git-versioned program | Your team already collaborates in Miro and wants agents to read/write boards | You want a polished freehand whiteboard/sketching UX | You keep a personal knowledge base and want simple visual note-linking | You want an AI-native thinking board and don't mind cloud lock-in | You're building custom multi-step orchestration and own the state layer yourself | You want a persistent personal agent that improves at repeated tasks over time |

**The honest tradeoff:** Miro, Excalidraw, and tldraw have years of polish on collaboration and drawing UX that Knowgrph doesn't try to compete with. What Knowgrph optimizes for is the layer underneath — a graph an agent can actually own, run, and version for free in a tool already on every machine: git.

**Why Hermes Agent is on this list despite having no canvas:** it's the clearest existing example of a framework that legitimately earns the word "self-evolving" — a real skill-creation-and-refinement loop, not a marketing gloss. Putting it in the same matrix makes the boundary concrete: Knowgrph doesn't compete on that axis and doesn't claim to. It competes on the canvas/graph-as-markdown axis, where Hermes has no equivalent at all. The two are complementary, not substitutes — a Hermes-style loop could in principle be one more surface reading and writing to a Knowgrph document, the same way DeerFlow/LangGraph already does.

## What "self-runnable agentic widget canvas" means

- **Markdown-native.** The source of truth is a Markdown file. Its YAML frontmatter declares the flow (`flow.nodes[]`, `flow.edges[]`, `socket_types`, `modelSelection`) with computing-flow-style KTV rows so the document is parseable, diffable, and version-control friendly — no proprietary binary scene format.
- **Widget canvas.** Nodes are typed widgets — `InputWidget`, `ComputeWidget`, `RichMediaPanel` (text, image, video) — laid out on a balanced, mobile-first canvas with readable, socket-typed edges.
- **Self-runnable.** Compute widgets carry a `canvas:runAction` (pure, inspectable functions) so a node can run from a button, a chat instruction, an MCP tool call, or a CLI/Codex entrypoint and write its outputs back into the same document.
- **Storyboard-projectable.** A frontmatter-owned 2D Storyboard can use source, ideation, invocation, projection, validation, and deploy-guard nodes to create cards, reusable elements, rich-media panels, and timeline lanes without hardcoded provider artifacts.
- **Agent-native.** Agents reach the canvas through local stdio MCP (`mcp/server.js`), read-only Pages HTTP MCP where deployed, Browser WebMCP, FloatingPanel Chat, or parser CLI/Codex entrypoints. Model or media calls are host-owned runtime decisions; paid, mutating, browser-auth, terminal, filesystem, egress, and deploy actions stay approval-gated.
- **Gated, persisted, replayable.** Runs are dry-run first; live spend halts at the first unapproved gate with zero paid actions. Outputs persist through the active Source Files, workspace, local artifact, or Cloudflare storage owner for the current lane.

## The runnable document model

A Knowgrph document's frontmatter flow is the program. Minimal shape:

```yaml
---
schema: "kgc-computing-flow/v1"
kgCanvas2dRenderer: "storyboard"
socket_types:
  idea_signal: {color: "#14b8a6", edgeWidthPx: 2, handleStrokeWidthPx: 2, accepts: [idea_signal]}
  artifact_signal: {color: "#8b5cf6", edgeWidthPx: 3, handleStrokeWidthPx: 3, accepts: [artifact_signal]}
flow:
  direction: {key: direction, type: string, value: "LR"}
  edgeType: {key: edgeType, type: string, value: "smoothstep"}
  balancedViewportPreset: {key: balancedViewportPreset, type: string, value: "widgetFrontmatter"}
  computed: {key: computed, type: boolean, value: true}
  snapToGrid: {key: snapToGrid, type: boolean, value: true}
  nodes:
    - id: {key: id, type: string, value: "source_input"}
      type: {key: type, type: string, value: "InputWidget"}
      label: {key: label, type: string, value: "Source Input"}
      handles: {key: handles, type: object, value: {"source":["idea"]}}
      "flow:portTypes": {key: "flow:portTypes", type: object, value: {"out":{"idea":"idea_signal"}}}
    - id: {key: id, type: string, value: "compute_summary"}
      type: {key: type, type: string, value: "ComputeWidget"}
      label: {key: label, type: string, value: "Compute Summary"}
      handles: {key: handles, type: object, value: {"target":["idea"],"source":["artifact"]}}
      "flow:portTypes": {key: "flow:portTypes", type: object, value: {"in":{"idea":"idea_signal"},"out":{"artifact":"artifact_signal"}}}
  edges:
    - {"id":"edge_source_to_compute","source":"source_input","sourceHandle":"idea","target":"compute_summary","targetHandle":"idea","type":"idea_signal"}
---

# Body markdown renders alongside the canvas.
```

- **Nodes** carry KTV fields, typed handles, a `canvas:widgetCard` (preview + actions), and, for compute nodes, a `canvas:runAction` describing inputs, outputs, and side effects.
- **Edges** connect source/target handles with a declared `socket_type`, so the canvas can validate and route connections.
- **Run** a compute node and its outputs (text, image, video, dashboards) flow to the connected `RichMediaPanel` widgets and persist to storage.
- **Project** a 2D Storyboard from frontmatter using the shared renderer contract: `flow.nodes[]` and `flow.edges[]` stay the source-owned SSOT, while Cards, Widgets, Rich Media Panels, BottomPanel Timeline, Gantt, and flowchart views render as projections.

## How it's built

A few terms get thrown around loosely in this space. Here's what Knowgrph specifically means by each, tied to an actual artifact — not as a headline claim, but as evidence:

- **Harness** — runs are dry-run first; live spend halts at the first unapproved gate with zero paid actions. Every run produces a `harness-proof.json` verification manifest alongside `state.json` (resumable) and `trace.jsonl` (step-by-step). `--fail-once <tool>` injects a bounded failure for recovery testing.
- **Orchestration** — DeerFlow v2 is a LangGraph-based kernel; the probe-tree feature runs as a second, independent LangGraph `StateGraph` on top of it, with KGC markdown (not LangGraph's native checkpointer) kept as the source of truth for conversation state.
- **SuperAgent** — a specific callable tool surface (`/superagent.run`, exposed via the local stdio MCP server), not a claim about the whole system. Any SuperAgent-scoped demo is explicitly labeled as scoped, consistent with the MainPanel readiness rule below.

What Knowgrph does **not** claim: this is not a self-modifying or self-improving system. `probe.evolve` evolves a conversation branch within probe-tree — it does not rewrite the agent's own code or capabilities. If a claim needs a footnote to walk it back, it doesn't belong here; the scoping above is the whole claim, not a preview of a bigger one.

## Agentic Canvas OS

Knowgrph is the Dev source for an **Agentic Canvas OS**: a local-first control plane where Markdown, KTV YAML frontmatter, Source Files, Canvas, chat, and MCP expose the same typed runtime state. The sibling `agentic-canvas-os/docs` tree is the current documentation control surface for this OS contract, defining the shared `/`, `#`, and `@` invocation dictionaries, runtime-readiness gates, MCP gateway rules, harness contracts, KTV computing-flow shape, and proof ledger.

The runtime direction:

- `/` commands describe bounded actions such as `/mcp.capabilities`, `/tool.catalog`, `/tool.route`, `/computing-flow`, `/superagent.run`, and `/runtime-ready.check`.
- `#` semantics scope intent, proof, and cost filters such as `#mcp`, `#tool-gateway`, `#computing-flow`, `#runtime-ready`, and `#long-horizon-harness`.
- `@` bindings name the source or runtime surface, e.g. `@source.frontmatter`, `@source.body`, `@mcp-gateway`, `@tool-policy`, `@sandbox-workspace`, and `@message-gateway`.
- The deterministic knowledge-graph lane uses the ACOS-owned exact tuples documented below; dictionary resolution is metadata-only and explicit stdio tool dispatch remains required.
- MainPanel MCP shows readiness and non-secret setup metadata. It does not execute tools or store credentials in browser settings.
- MainPanel readiness claims distinguish `documented`, `browser-published`, and `runtime-executable` states so doc guidance, browser snapshots, and executable MCP owners don't drift into one label.
- FloatingPanel Chat and KGC keep source-backed runtime materialization on the existing Markdown → KTV frontmatter → Canvas path.
- Local MCP, Pages HTTP MCP, Browser WebMCP, and approved Cloudflare control-plane owners are separate surfaces with explicit transport boundaries.

This README describes the Dev repo. `agentic-canvas-os/docs` remains docs-control runtime proof only. Its latest protected green revision is promoted by the scheduled lifecycle PR, and only a protected green Knowgrph `main` push may trigger the automatic Prod mirror and Cloudflare release.

### Deterministic local knowledge graph

The current local stdio extension adds three direct tool identities: `knowgrph.knowledge_graph.ingest`, `knowgrph.knowledge_graph.query`, and `knowgrph.knowledge_graph.explain_edge`. A local MCP client invokes those names directly. ACOS-capable hosts use `/knowledge.graph.ingest #knowledge-graph #mcp #runtime-ready @working-directory @knowledge-graph @operator @runtime-proof`, `/knowledge.graph.query #knowledge-graph #mcp #vcc @knowledge-graph @runtime-proof`, or `/knowledge.graph.explain #knowledge-graph #mcp #vcc @knowledge-graph @runtime-proof` before the explicit mapped tool call.

This path uses registered deterministic AST parsing for supported code and deterministic structural extraction for supported docs, SQL schemas, configs, and PDFs. Queries use lexical matching plus graph traversal, and every returned edge must be explainable from stored source evidence. Unsupported languages, file forms, PDF content, syntax, or relationships produce explicit diagnostics rather than guessed facts. Ingest, query, and edge explanation require no embeddings, vector store, model call, or network service.

[`Graphify-Labs/graphify`](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify) is clean-room, architecture-only inspiration for the product category. Knowgrph copies none of its code, prose, schemas, tool definitions, tests, fixtures, assets, prompts, commands, or output formats and does not clone, vendor, import, execute, call, or depend on Graphify.

The authoritative scope, provenance, diagnostics, and security requirements are in the [deterministic knowledge-graph runtime contract](docs/documents/knowgrph-deterministic-knowledge-graph-runtime.md).

### 2D Renderer: Storyboard template

The canonical neutral Storyboard seed sets `kgCanvasSurfaceMode: "2d"`, `kgCanvasRenderMode: "2d"`, and `kgCanvas2dRenderer: "storyboard"` so a source document can project into Cards, Widgets, Rich Media Panels, and BottomPanel Timeline without moving ownership out of frontmatter.

Its `flow` uses KTV rows for `direction`, `edgeType`, `balancedViewportPreset`, `computed`, `snapToGrid`, every node id/type/label, handles, port types, and runtime invocation fields. `socket_types` owns the allowed edge/port vocabulary, and every `flow.edges[]` entry references a declared socket type.

That template is intentionally local-first:

- runtime outputs start blank until an operator-approved local or live run returns evidence;
- `paid_call_count` starts at `0`;
- `source_url`, provider job ids, stream URLs, generated asset URLs, and runtime proof paths stay operator-supplied or runtime-generated;
- Prod mirror and Cloudflare are blocked from local, pull-request, and unprotected lanes; protected green `main` owns automatic release;
- Storyboard projection is view state only: authored frontmatter and source payloads own data, while visible connectors are projections of `flow.edges`;
- semantic HTML projection should use landmarks such as `main`, `section`, `article`, `header`, `nav`, `aside`, `figure`, `figcaption`, and `table` before falling back to generic layout wrappers.

The template's local runtime lane is source → ideation → invocation → Storyboard projection → runtime validation → deploy guard. In invocation grammar: `/source.normalize`, `/memory.seed`, `/harness.define`, `/canvas.project`, `/runtime-ready.check`, `/validation.run`, `/deploy.guard`, with `#frontmatter`, `#harness`, `#runtime-ready`, `#canvas`, `#approval-gate`, `#dev-only`, `@source.frontmatter`, `@source.body`, `@local-harness`, `@runtime-proof`, `@cost-log`, `@canvas`, `@operator`, `@dev-only`.

## Agent + automation surfaces

| Surface | How an agent uses it |
| --- | --- |
| Local stdio MCP (`mcp/server.js`) | Starts from an external MCP client and exposes Knowgrph-owned local tools: deterministic knowledge-graph ingest/query/edge explanation, Source Files search/fetch, UI launch, pipelines, memory, probe tree, showrunner, OS status, SuperAgent, video remix, browser bridge, HTML video, annotation, exact agent/LLM application catalog-plan-execute composition, and vdeoxpln inspection. |
| MainPanel MCP | Browser-local readiness and non-secret setup view for Knowgrph-owned and external MCP tool servers. |
| FloatingPanel Chat | In-canvas assistant with workspace, selection, invocation grammar, KGC generation, and source-aware context. |
| 2D Renderer: Storyboard | Projects frontmatter-owned source, ideation, invocation, runtime, review, and publish lanes into Cards, Widgets, Rich Media Panels, and timeline views. |
| Browser WebMCP | Browser-local read and inspection tools for Apps/WebMCP-capable hosts. |
| Pages HTTP MCP | Read-only published Source Files `search` / `fetch` surface where deployed. |
| Parser CLI / Codex | Run documents and harnesses headlessly from `knowgrph_parser` or Codex entrypoints. |
| Cloudflare control plane | Pages, Workers, D1, R2, AI Gateway, and payment/runtime owners when an explicit deploy lane is open. |

## MCP-compatible LLM readiness

MCP-compatible LLM hosts are ready to use Knowgrph today through the shipped public discovery and control-plane surfaces. The repo currently ships explicit setup and readiness contracts for ChatGPT/OpenAI Apps, Claude, Qwen Code, Kimi CLI, BytePlus ModelArk, and generic MCP clients that can talk to MCP over stdio or Streamable HTTP.

**Fastest path**

Map intent. Orchestrate agents. Prove outcomes.

A source-backed canvas where `/` routes work, `#` sets meaning, and `@` binds context.

One canonical operator contract: install and discovery stay on `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp`, while live `/`, `#`, and `@` grammar stays on `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/control-plane/mcp` or an app-owned forwarder until the host proves MCP session support.

Canonicalize the contract first, not the transport. The current dual-surface runtime remains intentional until hosted proof supports a single runtime claim.

1. Map intent: install `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp` first for public discovery, retrieval, and inspection.
2. Orchestrate agents: add `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/control-plane/mcp` only when the host can preserve MCP session state and you need live `/`, `#`, `@` grammar invocation.
3. Prove outcomes: for zero-spend evaluation, run the local parser or harness in `--provider-mode mock` before wiring any hosted MCP client.

For the canonical third-party install boundary, host recipes, and the explicit public-discovery vs control-plane split, see [`docs/documents/knowgrph-mcp-install-contract.md`](docs/documents/knowgrph-mcp-install-contract.md). For the one-page onboarding path that also links the release note, agent-ready doc, and MCP overview, see [`docs/documents/knowgrph-mcp-onboarding-index.md`](docs/documents/knowgrph-mcp-onboarding-index.md).
For the current min-viable-max-value Cloudflare AI Gateway execution queue, see [`docs/documents/knowgrph-ai-gateway-enhancement-plan.md`](docs/documents/knowgrph-ai-gateway-enhancement-plan.md).
For the canonical webpage embed boundary, see [`docs/documents/knowgrph-embeddability-contract.md`](docs/documents/knowgrph-embeddability-contract.md).

**Current topology**

| Surface | Endpoint | Role | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public discovery | `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp` | Canonical public install and discovery endpoint; read-only retrieval, prompt discovery, resource discovery, and inspection | Shipped |
| Control plane | `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/control-plane/mcp` | Approval-gated orchestration endpoint; exposes `knowgrph.agentic_canvas_os.docs.invoke` for live remote `/`, `#`, and `@` grammar invocation | Shipped |
| Local stdio MCP | `mcp/server.js` | Repo-local MCP surface for hosts that want the same grammar tool and the richer local tool catalog without the remote control plane | Shipped |

An MCP-compatible LLM can install the public Knowgrph server for discovery and retrieval, then route grammar invocation to the control-plane MCP surface when it needs live `/`, `#`, and `@` resolution against the current Agentic Canvas OS documentation contract.

For local provider-neutral application building, invoke `/application.compose #application-composition @application-manifest @component-catalog @integration-profile @runtime-proof`. The local stdio tools `knowgrph.application.catalog`, `knowgrph.application.plan`, and `knowgrph.application.execute` expose exact-version components, immutable mode-bound plans, and bounded owner-delegated execution; see [`docs/agent-application-composition.md`](docs/agent-application-composition.md).

Baseline runs are provable **offline with deterministic mock providers**. Real providers activate only when host-owned keys are wired and the matching gate is approved.

For hosted app-builder platforms (Lovable, Vercel, and similar) that expect a network-reachable HTTP/SSE MCP endpoint rather than a spawned local process: point the platform's MCP integration at `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp` for read-only discovery. For live `/`, `#`, and `@`, default to a thin app-owned forwarder and add `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/control-plane/mcp` directly only when the host proves it can preserve MCP session state.

**MainPanel readiness states** — use one label per claim:

- `documented`: static setup or operator guidance exists, no browser or executable runtime proof implied
- `browser-published`: the browser publishes a runtime snapshot or inspection artifact for the claim
- `runtime-executable`: a local or remote runtime owner actually registers the tool, route, or action

Current repo truth:

- MainPanel Integrations is anchored to the broader Settings-backed provider universe; any demo or SuperAgent subset must be called out as scoped.
- MainPanel MCP can contain both browser-published rows and documented-only connection guidance.
- External bridge ids such as `knowgrph.tool.search`, `knowgrph.tool.describe`, and `knowgrph.tool.call` are planned contract targets, not current executable runtime owners.

Release-gate checklist and readiness rubric: `docs/documents/knowgrph-mainpanel-readiness-rubric.md`.

## Quick start: run a document

Execute a Knowgrph canvas document headlessly with the `knowgrph_parser` CLI. For a fully offline deterministic run, pass `--provider-mode mock`:

```bash
python3 -m knowgrph_parser run-goal \
  --input docs/documents/your-canvas-doc.md \
  --goal-file goal.md \
  --output-dir data/outputs/my-run \
  --run-id my-run \
  --provider-mode mock \
  --print-summary
```

This writes the run to the output dir:

```text
data/outputs/my-run/
  state.json          # resumable run state
  trace.jsonl         # step-by-step execution trace
  final-report.md     # human-readable run report
  harness-proof.json  # verification manifest
  artifacts/          # generated text/image/video/canvas artifacts
```

Useful flags:

- `--provider-mode byteplus-modelark|mock` — `byteplus-modelark` (default, placeholder-backed media lane) or `mock` for deterministic offline runs.
- `--resume` — resume from `output-dir/state.json`.
- `--stop-after-step N` — checkpoint after N tasks, then stop (interruptible).
- `--fail-once <tool>` — inject one bounded failure for a tool (recovery testing).
- `--max-steps` / `--max-retries` / `--max-wall-seconds` — run budgets.

Convenience wrapper (uses the neutral fixture brief):

```bash
npm run goal:run
```

## Repository role

This repository is the Dev source of truth and the sole production deployment owner. Normal implementation and pull-request validation stay in Dev; after protected integration, a green `main` push automatically rebuilds, attests, deploys, browser-verifies, and publishes the generated mirror. The live public surfaces are `https://airvio.co/` and `https://airvio.co/knowgrph`.

## Workspace surfaces

| Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Source Files | Canonical Markdown documents (the runnable canvases), JSON, binary metadata, generated KGC, chat logs, traces. |
| Graph Canvas | Visual exploration + execution of the widget flow: nodes, edges, rich-media panels, layouts. |
| Floating Panel Chat | Agent-native assistant with workspace, selection, and source-aware context. |
| MainPanel Integrations | Provider, endpoint, model, auth-mode, storage, and runtime configuration for the Settings-backed provider universe; any narrower subset must be labeled as scoped. |
| Storyboard Widget | Structured 2D renderer editing over source-backed Markdown documents: Cards, Widgets, Rich Media Panels, reusable elements, and timeline lanes. |
| MainPanel MCP | Readiness rows and connection templates for local stdio, read-only Pages HTTP, Browser WebMCP, and external MCP tool servers, labeled by `documented`, `browser-published`, or `runtime-executable` state. |
| Agentic OS docs | Sibling control surface for `/`, `#`, `@` route dictionaries, MCP gateway policy, harnesses, and runtime proof. |
| Cloudflare Runtime | Pages, Workers (`McpAgent`), D1, R2, AI Gateway, and server-managed provider secrets when deploy is explicitly opened. |

## Repo layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `canvas/` | Vite/React app, editor workspace, Source Files, graph canvas, Storyboard Widget, MainPanel, chat UI, and focused tests. |
| `knowgrph_parser/` | Python parser and command-line tooling for markdown, GraphRAG, webpage, video, and workflow artifacts. |
| `grph-shared/` | Runtime-neutral TypeScript contracts for storage, rich media, markdown, payments, browser helpers, cache, and geometry. |
| `gympgrph/` | Geospatial package consumed by the canvas app. |
| `cloudflare/` | Pages handlers, Workers (incl. the `knowgrph-mcp` `McpAgent`), storage routes, D1 migrations, and R2-backed binary storage. |
| `mcp/` | Local stdio MCP server, tool contracts, local runtimes, and service documentation. |
| `data/config/` | Canonical config inputs for GraphRAG, schema, orchestrator, and LLM chat boundaries. |
| `docs/documents/` | Authored product, API, architecture, and feature documents. |
| `scripts/` | Repo checks, sync helpers, docs generation, storage seeding, payment readiness, and release tooling. |

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run setup
```

Prepare linked packages directly when working inside the canvas app:

```bash
npm --prefix canvas run prepare:linked-packages
```

Prepare the shared runtime required by repository smoke checks:

```bash
npm run smoke:prepare
```

The collaboration readiness gate runs this preparation automatically before its focused and browser smoke checks.

## Local development

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Use focused checks for the behavior being changed:

```bash
npm --prefix canvas run test:ci:unit -- <test-name-or-filter>
npm --prefix canvas run typecheck
npm --prefix canvas run check
npm --prefix canvas run doc:sanity
npm run api-index:check
python3 -m knowgrph_parser.webpage_cmd_test
```

Avoid broad test, publish, deploy, or remote mutation commands unless the current task requires them.

## Build, publish, deploy

Local build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Publish mirror build and sync:

```bash
npm run pages:build-sync
npm run pages:check-sync
```

Cloudflare deployment (Pages + Workers + `McpAgent`):

```bash
npm run pages:deploy-cloudflare
npm run mcp:worker:deploy
```

Run Cloudflare deployment, D1 mutation, R2 mutation, or production publish commands only after explicit operator instruction.

## Storage and source authority

Source Files are the workspace contract. Git-backed authored Markdown documents remain the source of truth; hosted storage mirrors and generated artifacts must preserve path identity instead of inventing parallel files.

- Keep GitHub-authored docs authoritative first.
- Use D1 and public storage routes as hosted mirrors and runtime indexes.
- Use R2 for binary artifacts (generated image/video) and companion outputs that do not belong inline in markdown. Persist media bytes to R2 on generate and store the durable R2 URL; never store an ephemeral provider URL as the artifact.
- Keep generated KGC, chat logs, traces, and output manifests source-file addressable.
- Use Launch → New .md for one-click authored Markdown creation under `/docs`; the action must reuse the shared Source Files creator and workspace timestamp helpers, then synchronously persist the blank file through the docs mirror instead of a toolbar-local file path.
- Do not hardcode provider, path, route, or demo-specific behavior downstream when a shared Source Files or storage owner should handle it upstream.

## Config and generated artifacts

Canonical config roots live under `data/config/`:

```text
data/config/graphrag/
data/config/llm-chat/
data/config/orchestrator/
data/config/schema/
```

Generated and local runtime outputs should stay ignored:

```text
.knowgrph-workspace/
data/outputs/
.wrangler/
*.tsbuildinfo
canvas/artifacts/live-verification/
canvas/.tmp-*
canvas/tmp-*
canvas/tmp_*
logs/
```

Do not commit local screenshots, transient previews, duplicate root-level config, local workspace notes, or runtime artifacts unless a specific test fixture contract requires a bounded source artifact.

## Feature docs

Feature-specific planning belongs in canonical docs instead of the root README:

| Feature | Docs |
| --- | --- |
| Agentic Canvas OS control surface | `../agentic-canvas-os/docs/` |
| Current startup priorities | `docs/documents/knowgrph-next-step-priorities.md` |
| 2D Renderer Storyboard template | `../huijoohwee.github.io/template/knowgrph-2d-renderer-storyboard-template.md` |
| Agentic Canvas OS PRD/TAD | `docs/documents/knowgrph-mcp/knowgrph-mcp-agentic-os-prd-tad.md` |
| AI provider layer (MiroMindAI) | `docs/documents/knowgrph-api-reference/knowgrph-miromind-api-prd-tad.md` |
| MCP | `docs/documents/knowgrph-mcp/` and `mcp/README.md` |
| Storage sync | `docs/documents/knowgrph-storage-sync-document.companion.md` |
| Strybldr | `docs/documents/knowgrph-strybldr-prd-tad.md` |
| Strytree | `docs/documents/knowgrph-strytree-prd-tad.md` |
| Repo hygiene | `docs/documents/knowgrph-repo-hygiene-document.md` |
| Payment readiness | `docs/documents/knowgrph-mainpanel-commerce-prd-tad.md` |

## Hygiene rules

- Fix root/source owners instead of layering downstream aliases, remaps, or compatibility shims.
- Keep the AI/agent layer, storage, graph, and Source Files behavior provider-neutral and file-agnostic where possible.
- Reuse shared helpers, semantic keys, and workspace contracts instead of hardcoded repo, file, route, or demo branches.
- Preserve source provenance for generated artifacts (link them to the goal, brief, plan, tool calls, and verification checks).
- Keep secrets out of source and use server-managed environment bindings for hosted provider keys.
- Keep Dev as the implementation source; publish mirror and Cloudflare outputs are generated from Dev.

## E2E Agentic Video Generation

Home **Agentic Video Canvas** and FloatingPanel Chat share one editable query contract:

```text
/video-agent @provider.byteplus @text @image @audio @video #spec.low @script.md
```

`/video-agent` selects the route; `@provider.byteplus` (default) or `@provider.openai` selects the provider; output `@` tokens select Text/Image/Audio/Video; and `#spec.low|#spec.medium|#spec.high` controls the declared specification. Enabled Markdown scripts remain canonical `workspace:` references but render through the existing `@*.md` inline-chip projection. A source-backed multilingual production request preserves Chinese, Cantonese, and English audio variants with synchronized Chinese/English subtitles, and projects generated artifacts through Cards, Widgets, Rich Media Panels, and BottomPanel Timeline video/FBF/audio lanes. Missing approval, credentials, or provider capability fails closed. This remains Dev-only and does not authorize a paid model call or Cloudflare deployment.

The default Source Files validation document is `../huijoohwee/docs/knowgrph-agentic-video-canvas-demo.md`; it keeps the supplied video-generation script as an `@`-inserted `workspace:` reference and starts all generated artifact fields blank until a provider returns them.
