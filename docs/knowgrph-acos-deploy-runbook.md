# Deploy Runbook — knowgrph ↔ agentic-canvas-os connector (Section 11 + tasks 12.7, 13.9, 13.10)

**Status:** Ready to run — **operator-gated** (requires cloud credentials + the
`cloud-deploy` Approval_Token). These steps make live, billable changes to
Cloudflare, AWS, and Vercel and call paid providers, so they are NOT executed by
the agent. Run them yourself in order.

All commands run from the `knowgrph` repo root unless noted. Local test/lint
gates must pass first: `npm run runtime:test`.

---

## Pre-reqs (one-time)

- Cloudflare: account + `airvio.co` zone; `wrangler login`.
- AWS: account + credentials (`aws configure`); CDK bootstrapped in the target
  region (`npx cdk bootstrap` once per account/region).
- Vercel: account + project; `vercel login`.
- Provider credentials (only the tiers you want live): Exa, BytePlus/ModelArk,
  Stripe. The product tiers (AWS/Vercel) hold **no** model keys (R11).

## 0. Gate: secret hygiene + tests

```
npm run runtime:test          # full suite (unit + PBT + integration + smoke), network-free, deterministic
```
The smoke tests assert no model-provider key ships in the Agent-API / McpAgent /
frontend tiers and no auth secret ships in the frontend bundle (R11.1/3/5, R15.7).
Runs with `--test-concurrency=1` so the gate result is independent of host core
count (deterministic across machines/CI).

## 1. Cloudflare control plane (task 11.1)

Provision live-client secrets (only if running live stages):
```
npx wrangler secret put EXA_API_KEY      --config cloudflare/workers/knowgrph-mcp/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret put BYTEPLUS_API_KEY --config cloudflare/workers/knowgrph-mcp/wrangler.toml
# set KNOWGRPH_LIVE_CLIENTS="1" + AI_GATEWAY_CHAT_URL / STRYTREE_RENDER_URL /
# KNOWGRPH_PAYMENT_URL in wrangler.toml [vars] to enable each live stage.
```
Deploy + verify the MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint:
```
npm run mcp:worker:deploy
curl -fsS https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp/health   # expect 200, status:"pass"
```

## 2. AWS Agent-API — REST tier (task 11.2)

> **Topology (task 13.11 — COMPLEMENT):** this API Gateway + Lambda + S3 tier is
> the product **REST** surface the Vercel frontend calls (`POST /auth/session`,
> `POST /run`, `GET /runs/{id}`, `GET /health`, S3 artifacts). It is **retained,
> not replaced** by the AgentCore Runtime — the AgentCore Runtime (§5) is an
> *additive* durable **MCP** tool surface (the deployable-agent judging
> artifact). Both are keyless thin forwarders to the Cloudflare `McpAgent`
> (R11 holds on either path). Deploy this tier whenever the frontend is in play;
> add §5 only when demonstrating the AgentCore deployable-agent artifact.

Create the HS256 signing secret (server-side only, R15.7):
```
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name knowgrph/agent-api/auth-jwt-secret \
  --secret-string "$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```
Install tier deps (so node_modules ships in the Lambda asset) and deploy:
```
npm run agent-api:install
CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=<acct> CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=<region> npm run agent-api:cdk:deploy
```
Set the control-plane endpoint on the Lambda env so the forwarder goes live
(export-swap gate, task 12.1): add `MCP_ENDPOINT=https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp`
to the run/runs Lambda environment (CDK `environment` or console). Verify:
```
curl -fsS <ApiUrl>/health                          # expect 200 within 5s
```

## 3. Vercel frontend (task 11.3)

```
npm run web:build
# deploy web/ to Vercel (point NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_API_URL at the AWS ApiUrl)
vercel deploy --prebuilt web   # or `vercel --cwd web`
```
Confirm no auth secret / model key is in the client bundle (the smoke test
covers this; re-run after build): `npm run web:test`.

## 4. Post-deploy verification + live proof (tasks 11.4, 12.7)

For a compact operator-ready checklist covering the live `/knowgrph` routes, MCP
session handshake, dry-run `tools/call`, and persisted Run_Manifest read-back,
see [knowgrph-post-deploy-verification-checklist.md](file:///Users/huijoohwee/Documents/GitHub/knowgrph/docs/knowgrph-post-deploy-verification-checklist.md).

```
AGENT_API_URL=<ApiUrl> \
MCP_ENDPOINT=https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp \
FRONTEND_URL=<vercel-url> \
AGENTCORE_MCP_URL=<optional-agentcore-runtime-base-url> \
npm run runtime:verify
```
This probes all three `/health`/reachability surfaces (5s-bounded) and prints a
sample Demo_Pack `urls[]`. When `AGENTCORE_MCP_URL` is set, the additive AWS
AgentCore `/ping` liveness URL and `/mcp` URL are included in the same
Demo_Pack block. Exit 0 = AC-7 reachability satisfied for every supplied URL.

**One approved live end-to-end run (task 12.7):**
1. `POST /auth/session` on the AWS API → Auth_Token.
2. `POST /run` with `{ referenceUrl, brief, budgetUsd, approvals: [] }` and the
   Auth_Token → confirm it halts `blocked` with ≥5 approval gates and **zero**
   spend (AC-1 / Property 2).
3. Approve each gate (issue Approval_Tokens via the HITL service), re-run with
   the approvals → the live path executes research (Exa) → storyboard (BytePlus)
   → render (Strytree/BytePlus) → publish → checkout (Stripe) via
   `executeLiveStages` (task 12.5a), gated by `enforceDirector*` (task 12.5).
4. Read back `GET /runs/{id}` → persisted terminal Run_Manifest + 7/7 Demo_Pack.
5. Capture the manifest + reachable URLs as the canonical judging artifact.

## 5. AWS AgentCore Runtime — MCP tier (tasks 13.9, 13.10) — OPTIONAL / ADDITIVE

> **Topology (task 13.11 — COMPLEMENT):** the AgentCore Runtime is an *additive*
> AWS surface — it does **not** replace the §2 API Gateway + Lambda + S3 REST
> tier. It hosts the durable streamable-HTTP **MCP** tool surface
> (`tools/list`, `knowgrph.video_remix.run` + stage tools, `/ping`) as the
> AWS-tier "deployable agent" judging artifact. Like the REST tier it is a
> **keyless thin forwarder** to the Cloudflare `McpAgent`: no model keys in the
> image/role/env, no direct paid-model invocation (R11 preserved; the IAM role
> grants no `bedrock:InvokeModel*`). Deploy this only when demonstrating the
> deployable-agent artifact; the frontend does not depend on it.

Gated by the `cloud-deploy` Approval_Gate (same gate as §1–§3). Build + push the
ARM64 image to ECR and launch the runtime, wiring the inbound JWT authorizer
(R15 Auth_Token), the least-privilege IAM role (no model-invoke permission), and
the control-plane endpoint env:
```
# local test first (network-free, fail-closed when control-plane endpoint unset)
npm run agentcore:test
# build + push ARM64 image and create the AgentCore Runtime
CLOUD_DEPLOY_APPROVAL_TOKEN=<token> \
MCP_ENDPOINT=https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp \
AUTH_JWT_SECRET=<server-side-secret> \
npm run agentcore:deploy        # wraps agentcore launch; set AGENTCORE_DEPLOY_COMMAND=deploy for newer CLI flows
# verify the deployed MCP endpoint + liveness
AGENTCORE_MCP_URL=<agentcore-runtime-base-url> \
AGENTCORE_AUTH_TOKEN=<auth-token-from-post-auth-session> \
npm run agentcore:verify        # tools/list over Streamable HTTP; /ping 200 within 5s
```
Register the deployed AgentCore MCP endpoint in the Demo_Pack `urls[]` and the
`runtime:verify` probe (task 13.10) so the Demo_Pack carries **both** AWS
endpoints — the REST Agent_Api `/health` (§2) and the AgentCore MCP endpoint —
as distinct reachable artifacts. Mark the section unverified if the endpoint
does not return success within 5s.

## Automated gate (CI)

The `.github/workflows/runtime-gate.yml` workflow automates §0 + §4 on a deploy
trigger (`workflow_dispatch` or a `repository_dispatch` of type `deploy`):

- Always runs `npm run runtime:test` (network-free).
- Runs `npm run runtime:verify` once at least one endpoint is configured. Wire
  the endpoints WITHOUT editing the workflow (no hardcode): set repository
  **Variables** `AGENT_API_URL`, `MCP_ENDPOINT`, `FRONTEND_URL` (or pass them as
  `workflow_dispatch` inputs). Until then the verify step skips with a notice, so
  the gate is inert pre-wiring and self-activates afterward.

## Rollback

- Cloudflare: `npx wrangler rollback --config cloudflare/workers/knowgrph-mcp/wrangler.toml`.
- AWS: `npm run diff --prefix aws/agent-api/cdk` then `cdk destroy` (the artifact
  bucket is `RETAIN` — delete manually if intended).
- Vercel: promote the previous deployment.
- AgentCore Runtime (§5, if deployed): delete the runtime via the starter
  toolkit / `agentcore` CLI and remove its Demo_Pack `urls[]` entry; the §2 REST
  tier is unaffected (the two AWS surfaces are independent — task 13.11).
- Unset `KNOWGRPH_LIVE_CLIENTS` / `MCP_ENDPOINT` to fail closed to mock/501.
