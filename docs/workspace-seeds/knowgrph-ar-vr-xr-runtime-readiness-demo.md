# AR/VR/XR Runtime-readiness Demo

This Source Files document is the dedicated workspace demo for the immutable
v3.0.0 AR/VR/XR authority. Its source identity is commit
`b41cc13b0798fb4e66ec9b3e8086ee13f6d72d99`, Git blob
`12aab1a46c230d5e006f78f4a87e3d0db93ed494`, and SHA-256
`38099b9a9838929dfa287e3be8317e7828562288a8303f43b1579728053d7bab`.
The mounted browser ledger remains AC-1–AC-12; the authority's AC-14 bridge is
a separate implementation candidate until its exact-revision proof passes,
and later revisions cannot silently expand the demo's evidence claim.

## Run the browser demo

Run `npm run dev`, then apply **Explorer → Source Files → docs →
workspace-seeds → knowgrph-ar-vr-xr-runtime-readiness-demo.md**. The applied
document activates the existing canonical XR world through the XR v2 runtime
adapter and opens Motion Control; it does not declare a second Three/XR world
owner. Run `npm run xr-v2:review-ready` from a clean checkout for the focused
source, unit, and Chromium evidence gate.

The graph source-authors the same ECS schemas, Hero/Marker entities, checker
material graph, exact-once behavior wire, particle emitter, rig, and timeline
sequence used by the mounted XR v2 authoring fixture. The AC-1 through AC-12
validation chain keeps every pinned criterion visible instead of promoting a
narrow edited-media slice into full-contract readiness.

## Camera and sensor control

Camera and sensor access starts disabled. The production host policy must allow
camera and required sensors for this application origin so the user can choose
to enable them; it must not disable the APIs at the host layer. Actual access
still requires an explicit user action and the browser permission grant. The
user can disable capture or sensors at any time, which must stop tracks,
sessions, and listeners. Denial fails closed to the non-capture viewer without
blocking the workspace.

## Readiness boundary

The v3 local browser demo is runtime-ready for AC-1–AC-12 after its clean
exact-candidate gate. AC-14 remains source-only, and the full pinned contract
remains `partial`. A browser smoke cannot
certify named phone camera/sensor lifecycle, sustained frame budget on reference
hardware, physical-headset behavior, track-preserving mux, or connected viewer
transport. Those are external physical-device and integration certification
gates. This seed claims neither Production availability nor deployment
authority.

## Demo checks

- [x] Source-authored `run_ready_demo.id: xr-v2` owns activation and conflicts fail closed.
- [x] Applying the document requests XR, 3D, XR stage, and Motion Control presentation.
- [x] The exact pinned commit, Git blob, and content SHA-256 are recorded.
- [x] The mounted authoring fixture and AC-1 through AC-12 are source-authored as graph nodes and edges.
- [x] The focused local browser gate is `npm run xr-v2:review-ready`.
- [x] Camera and sensors remain user-controlled and disabled until explicit opt-in.
- [x] Browser demo readiness is separated from external physical-device certification.
- [x] Production availability and deployment authority remain unclaimed.
