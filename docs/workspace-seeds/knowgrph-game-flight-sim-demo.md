# Native Flight Sim in XR Mode

This Source Files document is the local XR Mode runtime authority for one deterministic, browser-local flight mission. Applying it opens **Flight Sim** on the canonical Physics-authored XR world, prepares a healthy mission at tick zero, and waits for normalized input. It does not create another Canvas, renderer, terrain, collider catalog, camera driver, rendered XR world or scene owner, persistence owner, or deployment surface.

## Run locally

From the repository root, run `npm run dev`. In Knowgrph, open **Explorer → Source Files → docs → workspace-seeds → knowgrph-game-flight-sim-demo.md** and apply the document. The source-authored `run_ready_demo.id: flight-sim` activates XR/3D and the Flight Sim panel; an imported path is not required, and a conflicting known path fails closed.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Touch | Standard gamepad |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pitch / roll | W/A/S/D or arrow keys | Discrete Pitch/Roll buttons | Left stick |
| Yaw | Q / E | Discrete Yaw buttons | Shoulder buttons |
| Throttle up / down | Shift / Control | Throttle slider | Triggers |
| Pause / Resume / Reset | HUD or FloatingPanel controls | HUD or FloatingPanel controls | HUD or FloatingPanel controls |

The browser-local control contract uses `knowgrph.control_local_flight_sim` and strict `/flight.sim @canvas #flight`, with schema `knowgrph-flight-sim-mcp/v1`. Throttle is explicit: `/flight.sim @canvas #flight operation=throttle throttle=0.75`. Duplicate sigils, unknown keys, mixed native/structured input, missing tokens, and invalid lifecycle operations fail closed with a named diagnostic and offending token or field. Inspect and control return deterministic timeout, unavailable, execution, or validation envelopes within a hard 2,000 ms deadline.

**FloatingPanel → Flight Sim** controls Open, Start, Stop, Restart, Throttle, Save, and Exit. The panel projects runtime state only; the aircraft stage remains actor-only inside the shared renderer.

Camera source is independent of aircraft selection. In **FloatingPanel Camera → SHOOT**, choose the catalog's only two modes: **Fixed Follow** for stage-aware aircraft tracking or **Free Orbit** for direct pan, rotate, and zoom. The same shared catalog is invocable through `knowgrph.control_local_camera` with `/camera.select @camera #camera camera=fixed-follow` or `camera=free-orbit`. Flight supplies a pure aircraft follow/framing descriptor; the Physics controller hook alone mutates the camera and OrbitControls. Timeline camera-mark playback temporarily takes framing ownership, then returns to the selected source. Motion Control is optional normalized player input only and never becomes flight policy. Conflicting device commands resolve independently per axis to the value with the largest absolute magnitude.

Terminal results remain pending and never auto-save. **Save** is the only operation that persists validated Decisions through browser-local WorkspaceFs at `/game-flight-sim/mission-1-decisions.md`. Malformed bytes remain intact and block Start and Restart until **Reset local save** succeeds.

The mission uses the fixed `flight-meters-20` transform: one authored Singapore scene unit equals 20 mission meters, while Flight rendering and camera framing apply the inverse scale on the retained authored XR world. The simulation advances at exactly `1/60` second (approximately 16.667 ms, 60 Hz) and executes at most five catch-up ticks per advance. Capture exactly three waypoints in authored order and then the marked landing pad; all four objective radii are 50 m, and an out-of-order waypoint cannot advance progress.

Four meaningful systems run in stable transactional order: `InputIntegrationSystem`, `FlightModelSystem`, `CollisionResolverSystem`, and `ObjectiveSystem`. The Agentic ECS harness emits the one post-systems Cost_Log, and immutable render/HUD projection is captured only after the World commits. A failing system rolls back itself while retaining prior same-tick commits. Replay validates source, mission seed, input count/order/bytes, halts on the first divergence, and retains the last byte-equivalent committed World. Exit disposes the ECS World and unsaved in-memory mission state.

## Asset pipeline

The required aircraft loads from committed img2threejs-style TypeScript plus `vehicle-airplane.scene.json`: small, diffable, human-auditable, strict UTF-8, at most 1 MB, and offline. Its GLB fallback count is exactly zero. One optional beacon without an Asset_Spec uses the committed-local opaque `optional-beacon.glb`, licensed CC0-1.0 and pinned to SHA-256 `be41f87bb745ba35c439336d932dd69c34223d26e117443a3c8556e44fce70cd`, so the complete default load has one fallback. Remote, absolute, traversal, missing, unreadable, invalid, or unlicensed fallback references fail closed without fetching. Runtime code performs no image-to-3D model call, asset fetch, automatic grammar hydration, or Cloudflare request during Flight/Physics core play. The fixed 21-package Flight runtime closure is license-gated. Knowgrph contributors attest that this implementation and its assets are source-authored, with FlightGear and `Arnie016/flight-simulator-fable5` used only for concepts and architecture and no dependency taken on either project. The all-tracked-file scanner detects named identity, path, content-marker, binary/asset, and declared-dependency contamination; it does not prove the absence of arbitrary derived code.

## Runtime-readiness gates

- [x] Source identity is `flight-sim`, independent of import path, with conflict rejection.
- [x] Flight is an XR Mode overlay on the Physics source-authored world; it owns no second rendered XR world, scene owner, or Canvas.
- [x] Fixed Follow and Free Orbit come from the shared Camera catalog, and the Physics controller hook is the sole camera/OrbitControls mutator for the pure Flight framing descriptor.
- [x] The default load is spec-primary for the required aircraft and contains exactly one committed-local optional opaque GLB; remote and unavailable fallbacks fail closed.
- [x] Exactly 45 named fast-check properties are registered for at least 100 cases each (4,500 generated cases), alongside at least 126 focused source checks.
- [x] Browser proof enforces a clean exact branch/HEAD/tree and authored-seed SHA-256 before each of two fresh serial runs, including the ≤3 s first-frame, 375×812 HUD, lifecycle, camera, persistence-failure, pointer-lock contract, and zero-network fences.
- [x] `npm run game-flight-sim:runtime-ready` is the mandatory aggregate gate for the clean final candidate.
- [x] `npm run game-flight-sim:browser-smoke` requires two serial runs on that same exact candidate revision.
- [ ] The protected PR integrates the verified candidate.

The unchecked gates are proof/release state, not missing runtime behavior. This scope authorizes no Agentic workspace-seed projection, Prod/Cloudflare deployment, or public release.
