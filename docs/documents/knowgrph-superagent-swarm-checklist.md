# Knowgrph: 0 → 1 “SuperAgent / Swarm Intelligence” Repo-Level Checklist

## Current Source-Truth Update

Knowgrph now has a local, runnable SuperAgent harness baseline. The canonical
source-side contract is [knowgrph-superagent-harness.md](knowgrph-superagent-harness.md).
The runnable owners are `knowgrph_parser/superagent_harness.py`,
`knowgrph_parser/superagent_plan.py`, `knowgrph_parser/superagent_tools.py`,
`knowgrph_parser/superagent_verifier.py`, `mcp/server.js`, and
`mcp/local-tool-contract.js`.

The baseline is long-horizon and Deer Flow-inspired only at the conceptual
primitive level: message gateway, tools, skills, memory, subagents, sandboxed
workspace artifacts, and minutes-to-hours runs. It must not copy Deer Flow code,
clone Deer Flow architecture, create a provider-specific renderer branch, or
add downstream alias stacks around Source Files, MCP, Flow Editor, KGC, or
Rich Media Panel owners.

The current state meets the local SuperAgent harness threshold for repo-owned
runs and local MCP execution. The implemented task chain is
`inspect_goal -> select_skills -> research_goal -> code_sandbox ->
generate_text -> generate_image -> generate_video -> compose_canvas ->
verify_outputs -> synthesize_report`, with `skill.select`, `research.scout`,
and `code.write_and_run` proving skill/research/code lanes before media
creation. The declared task-depth levels are `quick_triage`, `bounded_compile`,
`deep_research`, and `parallel_build`; those levels describe run depth and
coordination style, while the task capabilities remain `research`, `code`, and
`create`. It does not claim a deployed public mutating SuperAgent service, and
it is not a Level 3 swarm-intelligence simulation.

This document is a **repo-level** checklist to distinguish:

- **GraphRAG / KG tooling** (single-process ingestion + retrieval + visualization), vs
- **SuperAgent harness** (planner + tools + subagents + sandbox + memory), vs
- **Swarm intelligence / multi-agent simulation** (many agents interacting in an environment with event/state logs).

It is organized as **0 → 1 maturity steps** across **User Flow + Work Flow + Data Flow**.

---

## Definitions (operational)

### “SuperAgent” (harness)
A system that can **plan**, **call tools**, **spawn/coordinate subagents**, and **produce verifiable artifacts** with **run tracing** and (usually) **sandboxed execution**.

### “Swarm Intelligence”
A system that runs **many agents** (often 10s–1000s) in a **simulation loop** with:
- explicit **environment/world state**
- **agent policies/personas/memory**
- **events** and **replayable logs**
- aggregate metrics / emergence patterns

---

## Level 0 — “Claim Only” (not implemented)

### User Flow (0)
- [ ] README uses terms like “super agent”, “swarm”, “multi-agent”, but **no runnable entrypoint** exists.
- [ ] No “Hello agent” quickstart (e.g., `make dev`, `npm run agent`, `python -m ... server`).
- [ ] No stable API surface for runs/threads (no `/threads`, `/runs`, `/tool-calls` concepts).

### Work Flow (0)
- [ ] No tool registry (`tools/`, `toolkit.*`, `toolRegistry.*`) or tool schema definitions.
- [ ] No planner/executor loop (no `planner`, `runner`, `executor`, `agent_loop` module).
- [ ] No agent runtime boundary (everything is just library calls / UI components).

### Data Flow (0)
- [ ] No run-step trace schema (no `Run`, `Step`, `ToolCall`, `Observation` records).
- [ ] No persisted outputs folder with conventions (`outputs/{run_id}/...`).
- [ ] No memory store schema (file/db) or migrations/versioning.

**If most checks here are true, “SuperAgent/Swarm” is branding, not capability.**

---

## Level 1 — Minimal Agent MVP (single-agent + tools)

### User Flow (1)
- [ ] **One obvious entrypoint**:
  - CLI: `python -m <pkg> run ...` / `npm run agent` OR
  - Server: `make dev` then `POST /chat` / `POST /runs`
- [ ] **Example config** is present and documented:
  - `.env.example`, `config.yaml`, or `config.json`
  - includes **model settings**, **tool enablement**, **timeouts**
- [ ] “Happy path” demo that produces an artifact (e.g., a markdown report) with reproducible steps.

### Work Flow (1)
- [ ] Tool registry exists, with:
  - [ ] tool names, inputs/outputs (typed or JSON schema)
  - [ ] tool error surface (timeouts, retries, rate-limit strategy)
- [ ] Agent loop exists (even if naive):
  - [ ] intent/planning step
  - [ ] tool selection and execution
  - [ ] observation ingestion
  - [ ] final answer synthesis
- [ ] Cancellation/timeout strategy exists (at least per-run).

### Data Flow (1)
- [ ] Run record model exists:
  - `run_id`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `status`, `error`
- [ ] Step record model exists:
  - `step_id`, `run_id`, `type` (plan/tool/answer), `inputs`, `outputs`, `latency_ms`
- [ ] Tool-call logging is persisted (file/db) with stable structure.
- [ ] Artifact output location is deterministic:
  - e.g., `outputs/<run_id>/report.md`

**Passing Level 1 means: “agent” is real and verifiable (not just UI naming).**

---

## Level 2 — SuperAgent Harness (subagents + skills + sandbox + memory)

### User Flow (2)
- [ ] UI or API exposes **threads/runs** and shows step-by-step tool calls.
- [ ] File upload + per-thread workspace:
  - upload → process → output artifacts
- [ ] A “skill” catalog exists:
  - list skills
  - enable/disable
  - run a skill with parameters

### Work Flow (2)
- [ ] **Subagent execution** exists:
  - [ ] task decomposition (fan-out)
  - [ ] parallel subruns
  - [ ] fan-in synthesis into final result
- [ ] **Sandbox abstraction** exists:
  - local vs docker vs remote provider
  - filesystem mapping (workspace/uploads/outputs separation)
- [ ] **Concurrency control** exists:
  - per-worker job limits, queueing, cancellation
- [ ] Skills are loadable modules:
  - `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (or equivalent)
  - skill loader/indexer
  - “toolbox” per skill

### Data Flow (2)
- [ ] Long-term memory store exists:
  - schema + dedupe rules + versioning/migrations
- [ ] Trace IDs exist across:
  - run → step → tool call → artifact
- [ ] Provenance model exists:
  - citations/links to sources
  - artifact metadata references inputs + steps

**Passing Level 2 means: “SuperAgent harness” is implemented.**

---

## Level 3 — Swarm Intelligence / Multi-Agent Simulation (environment + replay)

### User Flow (3)
- [ ] Create scenario/world from “seed” input (documents, signals, events).
- [ ] Configure simulation:
  - agent count, rounds/ticks, interventions, policies
- [ ] Run simulation + inspect:
  - timeline, event log, per-agent state
- [ ] Generate post-simulation report + drill-down into “why”.

### Work Flow (3)
- [ ] Simulation engine core exists:
  - `world/`, `sim/`, `scheduler/`, `tick_loop`
- [ ] Agent definitions exist:
  - persona/policy, memory, action space
- [ ] Interaction protocol exists:
  - message bus OR environment events
  - deterministic stepping (or controlled randomness with seeds)
- [ ] Metrics + stopping criteria exist:
  - emergent metrics, convergence/divergence, evaluation hooks

### Data Flow (3)
- [ ] World state schema exists (versioned).
- [ ] Append-only event log exists:
  - replayable, queryable
- [ ] Experiment tracking exists:
  - config snapshot → run → results
  - baselines + comparisons

**Passing Level 3 means: “swarm intelligence” is implemented beyond retrieval/traversal.**

## Evidence capture template (use for repo audits)

For each claimed capability, capture:

1. **Entrypoint**
   - path + command + expected output
2. **User flow proof**
   - UI route or API endpoint + screenshot/log
3. **Workflow proof**
   - modules/classes that implement loop/orchestration/simulation
4. **Data flow proof**
   - schemas + example run artifacts (1–2 files) + where persisted

---

## Current snapshot: `knowgrph` (high-level placement)

Based on current repo state:

- `knowgrph` remains strong in KG/GraphRAG ingestion, parsing, Source Files,
  Flow Editor rendering, and visualization.
- `knowgrph` now meets the local SuperAgent harness baseline:
  - CLI entrypoints: `python3 -m knowgrph_parser superagent`,
    `python3 -m knowgrph_parser run-goal`, `npm run goal:run`, and
    `npm run superagent:example`.
  - Local MCP entrypoint: `knowgrph.superagent.run`.
  - Planner/tool runtime: `SuperAgentHarness`, `build_plan()`,
    `build_agent_contracts()`, and the typed tool registry.
  - Role-scoped subagent contracts: planner, skill curator, research worker,
    code worker, text worker, image worker, video worker, canvas worker,
    verifier, and synthesizer.
  - Local workspace/sandbox boundary: caller-owned output directory with
    `state.json`, `trace.jsonl`, `goal.json`, proof manifest, final report,
    and generated artifacts.
  - Memory and trace: run observations, retry/recovery events, artifact
    provenance, and trace event counts.
- `knowgrph` is not Level 3 swarm intelligence:
  - no many-agent simulation engine
  - no world-state schema
  - no replayable simulation event log for emergent multi-agent behavior

So: **it meets Level 2 local SuperAgent harness for repo-owned runs, but not
Level 3 swarm intelligence and not a deployed public mutating agent service**.
