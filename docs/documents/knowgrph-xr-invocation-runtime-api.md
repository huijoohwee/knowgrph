# Knowgrph XR Invocation Runtime API

## Surface contract

FloatingPanel **Skills & Commands** hydrates the exact-revision Agentic Canvas OS `/`, `@`, and `#` dictionary as authoring metadata. A row inserts its token byte-for-byte into the active card editor; it does not execute an incomplete bare command.

Repo-local run-ready surfaces hydrate through the same-origin `/knowgrph/control-plane/mcp` route. They never suppress hydration or fall through to the production control plane. One shared, epoch-fenced group hydrator deduplicates `/`, `@`, and `#` requests, retries only sigils that resolved on a losing docs revision, and settles as `fresh`, `stale`, or `blocked` rather than retaining `loading` after work completes. The panel exposes its hydration status, catalog version, and exact source revision as runtime data attributes.

FloatingPanel **Media** owns complete dynamic XR invocations. Every visible invocation chip sends the identical displayed string, as the sole `invocation` input field, to `knowgrph.control_local_xr_scene`.

XR scene, Animation, and Camera MCP controls share Source Files document authority. While bootstrap or a document intent is resolving or failed, MCP inspection reports the scene as not ready, Media and Animation controls stay disabled, and Camera choreography rejects mutation without changing runtime state or graph metadata.

## Integrated readiness contract

- The `/`, `@`, and `#` catalog reconciles as one exact-revision transaction. A response is admitted only when its top-level `sourceRevision` matches the configured revision; an epoch change retries only sigils resolved by the losing revision and ends in `fresh`, `stale`, or `blocked`.
- Browser WebMCP registration is lifecycle-owned and late-bind safe: native-host attachment is bounded, detach releases owned registrations, and a readable local fallback remains available until native context is installed. The fallback is not a remote dependency or privileged bridge.
- Surface and operator ownership remain independent. Moving from Surface Mode to XR Mode retains an open Media or Skills & Commands panel; Camera opens a panel only when neither operator surface is already open.
- XR physics delegates fixed stepping to Knowgrph's independently authored spatial engine. The Rapier repository informed domain-separation principles only; no external source, prose, schema, algorithm, example, fixture, package, compatibility layer, service, or runtime dependency is admitted.

- Placement labels are URI-encoded in `/xr.place` and decoded before bounded scene mutation.
- `/xr.transform` retains the selected asset, position, yaw, scale, and color.
- Static placements retain `transition=hold`.
- Camera WebMCP framing preserves an already-open Media or Skills & Commands panel; Camera opens only when no operator panel is open.
- Surface Mode to XR Mode preserves an already-open Media scene panel and an already-open Skills & Commands operator panel. Closed, unrelated, or Game Mode panels enter through Motion Control.

## WebMCP readiness markers

The app and published HTML fallback expose two independent diagnostics:

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `data-kg-webmcp-context` | Usable tools: `fallback-readable`, `awaiting-model-context`, or `installed`. |
| `data-kg-webmcp-host-context` | Native host binding: `installing`, `awaiting-model-context`, `retry-exhausted`, or `installed`. |

A bounded native-host retry cannot overwrite a functional `fallback-readable` context as an apparent runtime failure. Assigning a native model context after retry exhaustion still installs the complete tool set.

If a native host detaches, its AbortSignal-backed registrations are released, the owned fallback becomes readable again, and a fresh bounded binding cycle begins. Test reset detaches the owned `navigator.modelContext` and `document.modelContext` descriptors before clearing fallback identity, so reinstalling in the same document cannot misclassify the old fallback as native.

## Evidence boundary

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Protected source and build | PR #307 merged as `df312d72d3e163bbcc3e9f19ca299223f9a54431`; Integration Gate run `29895795869` passed on reviewed head `f914723570a126fdc6262d1efddfdc994a2c0eb5`. |
| Focused runtime | XR surface routing, literal Media dispatch, exact-revision grammar, WebMCP lifecycle, Source Files fencing, TypeScript, hygiene, MCP docs, and production-readiness selectors passed. |
| Browser | Same-origin MCP requests, panel continuity, literal `/xr.place` dispatch, readable WebMCP fallback, and zero browser/runtime errors passed on the behavior-equivalent pre-final feature state. The final merge itself was not re-run through browser acceptance. |
| Production | No Prod, Cloudflare, provider-spend, or live-public-runtime claim is made by this Dev evidence. |

## Ownership and boundary

- Runtime owner: `canvas/src/features/three/xrSceneMcpRuntime.ts`.
- Invocation grammar owner: `canvas/src/features/three/xrSceneMcpContract.mjs`.
- Exact-revision dictionary metadata owner: Agentic Canvas OS `DICTIONARY-COMMAND.md`, `DICTIONARY-SEMANTIC.md`, and `DICTIONARY-BINDING.md`.
- Local docs discovery owner: `mcp/agentic-canvas-os-docs-runtime.js`; explicit roots win, otherwise a marker-backed ancestor search resolves the canonical sibling checkout, with Git common-directory recovery for registered worktrees outside the workspace tree. Configured revisions must equal checkout `HEAD`, and the docs tree must be clean.
- Browser registration owner: `canvas/src/features/agent-ready/webMcpRuntime.ts`.
- Lifecycle owner: `canvas/src/features/agent-ready/webMcpLifecycle.mjs`; the published fallback serializes this owner through `webMcpLifecycleBrowserSource.mjs` instead of maintaining a second implementation.
- Workspace mutation diagnostics stay in the shared in-memory runtime trace; XR Media persistence performs no hardcoded localhost debug-collector requests.
- Published projection owner: `cloudflare/pages/knowgrph-agent-ready.mjs`.

The native 2D/3D physics contract is documented in `docs/documents/knowgrph-native-physics-engines-prd-tad.md`. Rapier remains a principles-only reference, not a dependency; this runtime copies no external implementation, schema, prose, algorithm, example, fixture, or test and introduces no external renderer, physics runtime, storage, deployment, or mutation owner.
