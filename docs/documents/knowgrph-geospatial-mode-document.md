# Knowgrph Geospatial Mode Document

**Context**: Map-oriented exploration on top of the 2D infinite canvas  
**Intent**: Overlay basemap + geo layers without breaking graph-first affordances  
**Directive**: Drive behavior via configuration (no hardcoded datasets/providers), bound all fetch/parse work, and preserve graph-first defaults (overlay is off until explicitly enabled, except optional auto-enable on geo imports)

---

## Status (2026-04-02)

- Knowgrph keeps Geospatial Mode logic out of its codebase and loads it on-demand from the sibling repo `gympgrph` (implementation lives in `gympgrph/src/`).
- Knowgrph exposes a toolbar entrypoint (**Geospatial Mode**, right of **3D Mode**) that opens the Floating Panel **Geo** view and toggles the gympgrph overlay.
- **3D render mode uses MapLibre Globe exclusively** (Cesium has been removed). The 3D overlay renders via the same MapLibre instance, switching from Mercator to globe projection. Initial 3D camera is deterministic: Singapore center (`lng 103.8198, lat 1.3521`), zoom `2.8`, pitch `0`, bearing `0`, applied as a single `jumpTo` call with zero padding, followed by one RAF stabilization pass. Passive auto-fit is disabled in 3D mode so the startup camera is never immediately overwritten. Explicit fit requests (user-initiated or data-driven) remain fully functional.

## Current Status (Runtime Overlay)

- In the extracted module, a MapLibre GL basemap renders as a translucent layer on top of the canvas.
- The overlay supports interaction gating (**Off / Hold Space / Always**). Default interaction mode is **Always** for immediate navigation, and users can switch in the Geo panel.
- Geospatial Mode is a canvas rendering mode: when **ON**, the canvas suppresses knowledge-graph rendering (nodes/edges/layers/rich media) so the map overlay and geospatial datasets are the primary surface.
- Floating Panel open/close does not toggle Geospatial Mode.
- MapLibre’s required CSS is loaded by the extracted module so host runtimes do not need to remember to import it separately (restores reliable drag/pan/zoom + pointer hit-testing).
- **Default Style**: Uses **OpenFreeMap Liberty** (`https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty`) as the default basemap if no style URL is provided.
- **Style URL Note**: The OpenFreeMap style endpoint is the `.../styles/<styleName>` path (no trailing `/style.json`). If a pasted URL ends with `/style.json`, it should be normalized to the canonical endpoint to avoid 404s.
- Projection is configurable (**Auto / Mercator / Globe**). In **Auto**, 3D render mode uses a globe-style projection.
- Dataset layers can be added as http(s) URLs (GeoJSON or record-style JSON) and rendered as points/lines/polygons.
- Same-origin datasets can also be referenced as absolute paths (starting with `/`) so hosts can serve local GeoJSON/JSON without CORS.
 - Host-side JSON imports that contain geo fields (e.g. `lat/lon` or `geo.{lat,lng}`) can be ingested as **sampled geodata** without parsing the entire JSON payload (prevents UI freezes on very large object-map datasets).
- Clicking a rendered **POI** selects it:
  - Graph-node POIs select the corresponding graph node in the main canvas (selectionSource aligns with canvas clicks).
  - Dataset POIs show a lightweight selection marker + popup with dataset/feature details.
  - Dataset POIs may also open a bounded, right-side details panel when the feature carries markdown/media properties (dataset-agnostic; driven by feature metadata).
  - POI clicking follows the interaction gating (Off / Hold Space / Always).
- Dataset point layers can optionally render as clusters (MapLibre GeoJSON source clustering). Clustering is configuration-driven and dataset-agnostic.
- When GraphData nodes carry geo fields, the overlay may render both **graph nodes** (points) and **graph edges** (lines) directly on the basemap, as a pure view projection of GraphData (no ingest-time derivation in the overlay).
- Geo fields are read from `GraphData` node properties when present (the module does not derive geo fields during ingest).
- “Fit to data” computes a bounded bbox and updates the overlay camera (optional animation).
- In 3D render mode, the overlay auto-fits to active geo bounds so the globe doesn’t appear “blank” by default.
- In 3D render mode, when a graph selection contains geo-capable nodes, auto-fit prefers the selection bounds so Zoom-to-Selection stays aligned with the map.

### Reliability Notes

- The MapLibre instance is created once per enable-cycle (not on every dataset/graph update) to avoid cancelling in-flight style loads.
- In React dev StrictMode, effects mount/unmount twice; map creation is deferred to the next tick so the “probe” mount does not trigger aborted style requests.
- When enabling the overlay, if the persisted opacity is `0` the implementation restores a safe default opacity so the overlay cannot be “enabled but invisible”.
- Map style load failures are surfaced (console + toast) instead of silently producing a blank map.
- A persistent “blank overlay” state is prevented by warning when overlay opacity is `0%` and by timing out basemap load with a bounded error message.
- Cross-origin asset proxying is **dev-only**: on localhost, cross-origin map assets (style JSON, sprites, glyphs, tiles, and dataset fetches) can be routed through `/__fetch_remote` to avoid CORS issues; in production/static deploys the proxy does not exist, so assets must load directly.
- The `/__fetch_remote` proxy must not abort upstream fetches on request `close` events; premature aborts truncate style/tile/glyph responses and cause silent “blank basemap” failures in MapLibre.
- Style-relative URLs are resolved against a trailing-slash base (for example `.../styles/liberty/`) so `sprite`, `glyphs`, and `source.url` relative paths resolve correctly.
- Runtime overlay status is surfaced via a native in-app toast (top-right, below the toolbar) so it stays visible above the Floating Panel and other UI layers.
- Hover and click popups are rendered by MapLibre (not by the host UI) to keep POI feedback colocated with the map.
- If the basemap stays blank after refresh while requests succeed, the most common cause is a **0px-height overlay container** (e.g. `canvas=1728x0`). The overlay is mounted via a portal and forces viewport-sized layout (`100vw/100vh` with px fallbacks) and calls `map.resize()` to avoid this dead state.

### Troubleshooting: “Loaded” but blank

- Symptom: toast shows `styleLoaded=yes`, `tilesLoaded=yes`, `sourceLoaded=yes` but `canvas=...x0` and the basemap is invisible.
- Cause: the overlay DOM element has `height: 0` after refresh/layout transitions, so MapLibre has no drawable area.
- Fix: ensure the overlay is mounted at `document.body` (portal), forced to viewport size, and that `map.resize()` runs after style/load/resize events.

## User Journey

1. User loads a dataset into the graph.
2. In the extracted module UI, user enables the runtime overlay.
3. A translucent basemap overlay appears on top of the canvas (defaulting to OpenFreeMap) while graph interactions remain primary.
4. User optionally configures interaction/projection/animation settings in the overlay panel UI.
5. User adds one or more dataset URLs via **Source Files** (Workspace Actions), optionally registering them as Geo layers to render additional map overlay layers.
   - For local Markdown Source Files, embedded fenced `geojson` code blocks (GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`) can also be registered as overlay datasets by extracting and uploading the blocks to the bounded local dataset cache.
   - For local JSON Source Files, record-style datasets (array-of-records or object-map records) can be converted into a derived GeoJSON Point FeatureCollection and registered as an overlay dataset.
   - For local Markdown itinerary documents (no embedded GeoJSON), implementations may derive POIs from headings + tokens (e.g. airport codes) and resolve coordinates using a bounded, in-memory index built from already-registered point datasets.
   - In the Bottom Panel Markdown Viewer, fenced `geojson` blocks can render an inline MapLibre preview (Render mode) using the same basemap/style loading behavior as Geospatial Mode.
6. User clicks **Fit to data** to move the basemap camera to the combined bounds of the active geo layers.

## Data Contract

### Graph Nodes

- Geo-capable nodes carry `node.properties.geo.lat` and `node.properties.geo.lng` as numbers.
- Geo is derived from dataset-agnostic shapes:
  - **GeoJSON**: `FeatureCollection | Feature | Geometry`
    - Each Feature becomes a graph node.
    - Point Features derive `properties.geo` from `[lng, lat]`.
  - **Records**: generic record datasets with common coordinate fields
    - Supported record containers include arrays of objects and object maps (key → record).
    - Supported coordinate shapes include `geo.{lat,lng}` and `lat/lng`, `latitude/longitude`.

### Map Overlay Datasets

- Dataset layers are stored as URL references and loaded at runtime.
- Same-origin dataset URLs may be produced by uploading local GeoJSON text (`/__geo_upload` → `/__geo_local/...`), including when the GeoJSON is embedded inside a local Markdown Source File as a fenced `geojson` block.
- The local upload handler must enforce a bounded byte limit and should be configurable (for example `KNOWGRPH_LOCAL_GEO_DATASET_MAX_BYTES`) so large-but-common fixtures (≈20MB GeoJSON city datasets) remain supported without unbounded growth.
- Load is bounded by fetch size/time limits and uses best-effort parsing:
  - **GeoJSON**: Render directly.
  - **Records**: Derive a GeoJSON Point FeatureCollection when coordinate fields are detected.

## Implementation Map (Import → Render)

- Knowgrph pipeline (import → parse → store → render) remains in:
  - Parse routing: `canvas/src/features/parsers/default.ts` → `canvas/src/lib/graph/io/adapter.ts` (`parseGraph`)
  - Store commit: `canvas/src/hooks/store/graphDataSlice.ts` (`setGraphData`)
  - Render: `canvas/src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx` → `canvas/src/components/GraphCanvas/scene.ts`
- Extracted Geospatial Mode implementation lives in `gympgrph/src/`:
  - Overlay render + interaction gating: `gympgrph/src/features/geospatial/GeospatialOverlay.tsx`
  - Basemap lifecycle: `gympgrph/src/features/geospatial/useMapLibreBasemap.ts`
  - Dataset URL loading + layer creation: `gympgrph/src/features/geospatial/geospatialOverlayUtils.ts`
  - POI selection mapping: `gympgrph/src/features/geospatial/geospatialPoiSelection.ts`
  - UI controls: `gympgrph/src/features/geospatial/GeospatialPanel.tsx` (host may hide the dataset importer and consolidate import into Source Files)
  - Geo derivation helpers: `gympgrph/src/lib/graph/geo/*` and `gympgrph/src/lib/geospatial/*`

---

## Configuration & Persistence

- The extracted module keeps the original persistence/config design (LS-backed settings + optional env overrides) for future reuse.
- Knowgrph defines and reads the Geospatial Mode persistence keys so the host can gate rendering and keep embedded previews in sync, but the write-path lives in `gympgrph`’s store actions (e.g. `setGeospatialOverlayEnabled`).
- Runtime sync uses a shared UI event contract in `grph-shared`:
  - Event name: `GEOSPATIAL_MODE_CHANGED_EVENT`
  - Helpers: `emitGeospatialModeChanged` and `onGeospatialModeChanged`
- Persistence keys are namespaced to avoid collisions when multiple apps share the same origin:
  - `kg:ui:geospatial:*`
  - The primary host gate is `kg:ui:geospatial:overlayEnabled` (boolean).

### Host ↔ Preview sync (same-origin)

- **Same-document**: `gympgrph` dispatches `kg:geospatialModeChanged` as a `CustomEvent` when toggled so host UI (Toolbar/Canvas) can update immediately.
- **Cross-document**: `gympgrph` writes `kg:ui:geospatial:overlayEnabled` to `localStorage`, and the host listens for the browser `storage` event to keep other tabs and any external embedded preview iframe synchronized.

### Host Integration Notes

- `gympgrph` treats `maplibre-gl` as a host-level dependency (peer) to prevent duplicated nested installs and to allow the host bundler to prebundle the CommonJS/UMD build for ESM dev servers.
- `gympgrph` uses Tailwind utility classes in its UI (panel + overlay). When hosted inside Knowgrph, Tailwind must scan `gympgrph/src` so required classes (including stacking / pointer capture) are generated.
  - Knowgrph host config: `canvas/tailwind.config.js` includes `../gympgrph/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` in `content`.
- The overlay container hardens critical layout properties (full-screen fixed positioning, z-index, pointer-events) via inline styles to avoid “map visible but non-interactive” failures when utility-class CSS is stale or missing.

### Dataset Fetch Limits (UI)

- Dataset fetch is always bounded by `timeoutMs` and `maxBytes` (user-configurable).
- In Knowgrph, the host UI surfaces these controls in **MainPanel Workflow → Step 3 (Ingest) → Dataset fetch limits** to avoid duplicating configuration in the Geo side panel.
- The Geo side panel does not render fetch-limit inputs; it only provides geospatial overlay configuration and a small icon hint pointing users to Source Files for dataset add/import.
- Default `maxBytes` is sized to handle common public GeoJSON datasets (for example ~20MB city datasets) while still remaining bounded.
- If a dataset is too large (based on Content-Length when available), loading fails early with an actionable error instead of streaming indefinitely.
- Basemap style/tiles are fetched via the local `/__fetch_remote` proxy when running on localhost to avoid CORS issues; binary tile responses are served with a corrected Content-Length to prevent truncated PBF parsing errors.
- Dataset status shows streaming progress when Content-Length is available (bytes + %), and datasets can be reloaded via an icon action without remove/re-add.

### Graph POI Styling (UI)

- Graph-node POIs are rendered as a dedicated overlay layer and are always clickable (an invisible hit layer is used to make selection reliable).
- The Map panel exposes color pickers for:
  - Graph POI color
  - Selected outline color

### Dataset Format (Auto)

- The dataset “format” selector is intentionally removed from the UI: parsing is auto-detected (GeoJSON first, then record-derived points).
- Record datasets support common coordinate shapes (e.g. `lat/lng`, `latitude/longitude`, `geo.{lat,lng}`, `location.{lat,lng}`, `geometry.coordinates`).

### Fit Behavior

- Map panel “Fit to data” is consolidated with existing fit/zoom commands:
  - When Geospatial Mode is active, zoom/fit commands route to the geospatial overlay camera and do not trigger graph-canvas zoom pipelines.
  - When Geospatial Mode is off, zoom/fit commands route to the active graph renderer.

### Host Auto-Enable (Import)

- Knowgrph can auto-enable Geospatial Mode immediately after a successful geo-capable import.
- This is controlled by `autoEnableGeospatialOnGeoImport` (persisted under `kg:ui:geospatial:autoEnableOnGeoImport`).

## Multi-Dataset Demo (Airports + Countries + Cities)

**Purpose**: Show how to configure three independent Geo layers (Airports, Countries, Cities) via Source Files / Geo panel without hardcoding dataset URLs into production code.

> These are documentation-only examples. The application must not ship with hardcoded dataset URLs; users configure them via environment or UI.

### Step 1 — Prepare dataset URLs (outside of code)

- **Airports (records)**: public airports dataset in JSON (array or object-map of records with lat/lng fields).
- **Countries (GeoJSON)**: country polygons in GeoJSON.
- **Cities (records)**: city records (with coordinates) in JSON.

Store these URLs in environment configuration (for example `VITE_GEOSPATIAL_DATASETS_JSON` in your host) or paste them at runtime into the Geo panel “Dataset URL” inputs. Do not embed them inside source files.

### Step 2 — Register datasets as layers

There are two host-level paths to register Geo layers:

1. **Via environment catalog (recommended for demos)**
   - Set `VITE_GEOSPATIAL_DATASETS_JSON` to a JSON array that describes Airports / Countries / Cities.
   - Example (pseudo-structure):

```jsonc
[
  { "id": "layer-airports",  "label": "Airports",  "url": "<AIRPORTS_URL>",  "format": "records", "enabled": true },
  { "id": "layer-countries", "label": "Countries", "url": "<COUNTRIES_URL>", "format": "geojson", "enabled": true },
  { "id": "layer-cities",    "label": "Cities",    "url": "<CITIES_URL>",    "format": "records", "enabled": true }
]
```

   - At runtime, the geospatial slice reads this JSON, normalizes `blob` URLs to `raw` (via `normalizeGitHubBlobLikeUrl`), and stores them in `geospatialDatasets`.

2. **Via Geo panel UI (per-session configuration)**
   - In Knowgrph, open **MainPanel Workflow → Step 3 (Ingest) → Source Files**.
   - Add or select three Source File rows (for example “Airports”, “Countries”, “Cities”).
   - For each row:
     - Use the URL import control to enter the dataset URL.
     - Use the Geo toggle/checkbox to register it as a geospatial dataset (the host calls `addGeospatialDatasetUrl` with `{ label, url, format: 'auto' }`).

Both approaches use the same underlying dataset model and helpers (`addGeospatialDatasetUrl(s)`, `parseGeospatialDatasetFormat`, `loadDatasetFeatureCollection`).

### Step 3 — Enable Geospatial Mode (MapLibre overlay)

1. In the Canvas toolbar, click **Geospatial Mode** (Geo button) to open the Geo side-panel tab.
2. Ensure Geospatial Mode is **enabled** (overlay toggle ON) and interaction mode is `Always` (default).
3. Verify that the MapLibre basemap (default: OpenFreeMap Liberty) is visible as a translucent overlay on top of the 2D canvas.

At this point, Document Mode (graph canvases) and Geospatial Mode share the same GraphData and selection state, but the host enforces **mutual exclusivity**: when Geospatial Mode is enabled, graph canvases are unmounted so they cannot run background rendering/recalculation or consume shared requests.

### Step 4 — Observe multi-layer overlay + clustering

1. In the Geo panel, confirm that all three datasets appear in the dataset list with their labels (“Airports”, “Countries”, “Cities”).
2. Ensure each dataset is **enabled**:
   - Countries (GeoJSON polygons) should render as polygon/line layers (fill + outline).
   - Airports / Cities (records) should render as point layers derived from record coordinates.
3. Enable clustering (if not already enabled) via the Geo panel cluster controls:
   - `geospatialClusterEnabled = true`
   - Adjust `geospatialClusterRadius` and `geospatialClusterMaxZoom` as needed.

The MapLibre overlay now shows three simultaneous layers:

- A polygon layer for country boundaries.
- A clustered point layer for airports.
- A clustered point layer for cities.

### Step 5 — Use “Fit to data” and verify automatic bounds

1. In the Geo panel, click **Fit to data**.
2. The overlay computes combined bounds across all active datasets (Airports + Countries + Cities) using `computeBoundsFromCollections` (Turf `bbox` under the hood).
3. The MapLibre camera animates (if enabled) to show all layers in a single view:
   - In **2D** render mode, the map uses the same world bounds as the canvas, so graph-first affordances remain intact.
   - In **3D** render mode, the overlay prefers selection bounds if a geo-capable graph selection exists; otherwise it uses dataset bounds.

### Step 6 — Keep configuration neutral and bounded

- Dataset URLs live in environment config or user input, not in compiled code.
- Fetch behavior remains bounded:
  - `geospatialDatasetTimeoutMs` and `geospatialDatasetMaxBytes` control timeout and max bytes.
  - Oversized or slow datasets fail with clear, actionable messages (no infinite fetch loops).
- The same pipeline accepts any Airports/Countries/Cities-style dataset that respects the coordinate contract, not just the example sources above.
