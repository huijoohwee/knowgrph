# KnowGrph 2D Renderer Enhancement (Design)

## Scope

- This document defines the 2D renderer enhancement goals and constraints for in-repo, native implementation.
- It applies to 2D render variants (D3 Graph, Flowchart, GitGraph, Flow, Design, Flow Editor) and their shared behaviors across touchpoints; 3D and Voxel modes reuse the same SSOT GraphData/layout and canvas.jsonld contracts and are documented in the renderer and AgenticRAG Canvas directives.

## Hard Constraints

- Native in-repo implementation only.
- Forbid hardcoded or runtime dependencies on upstream design-tool repositories.
- Reuse existing SSOT for tokens, typography, icons, labels, and tooltips.
- Maintain unidirectional data flow: Store → Derivation → Render; forbid renderer mutating canonical store graph objects.
- Forbid cross-mode drift: switching touchpoints/modes/layouts/zooms must not change semantics.

### Repo Policy

- Enforced by the repo policy test `forbidPenpotRepoLiteral`.
- Do not include upstream repo identifiers in any form (URL, SSH remote, or owner/repo string) anywhere in-repo.

## Renderer Variants (2D)

### D3 Graph (SVG)

- Best for simulation-driven force layouts, immediate interaction, and inspectable DOM.
- Main risk: DOM churn (labels, edge paths) and tick-bound geometry work.

### Flow (Canvas2D)

- Best for high-density graphs and consistent frame budget.
- Main risk: inconsistent semantics vs D3 (fit/zoom, selection, group envelopes) if derivations diverge.

### GitGraph (Mermaid SVG)

- Best for Git history, branch, commit, checkout, and merge diagrams authored in YAML frontmatter `mermaid: |`.
- Main risk: parser drift if GitGraph commands are expanded by the Flowchart topology parser. GitGraph must remain diagram-code rendering unless a future source-owned semantic parser is added.

### Flow Editor (Canvas2D + Semantic Overlays)

- Best for editing workflows and flow editor widgets.
- Main risk: overlay re-render churn and viewport transform drift.

### Design (2D Webpage Wireframe)

- Best for DOM-derived webpage wireframes rendered as 2D frames over a neutral layout snapshot graph.
- Uses a browser-native layout export (`webpageLayout` snapshot) and deterministic DOM→graph conversion with domain-agnostic wrapper pruning, layout-glue cleanup, and synthetic section nodes. Export is implemented via a sandboxed hidden iframe (`kg-export-dom` layout mode) with URL-agnostic timing (networkIdle + domQuiet) and bounded snapshot capture.
- Frame layout is snapshot-driven: when a `webpageLayout` graph is available, Design uses DOM-derived coordinates and dimensions as the SSOT; when no snapshot is ready yet, Design shows a single placeholder frame (loading/error/idle) instead of a legacy non-webpage frame grid.
- Shares collective fit/center, zoom view keys, snap-to-grid, lasso, and align/distribute semantics with D3 and Flow, plus renderer-neutral shortcuts for align/distribute and keyboard nudging.
- Wireframe presentation is driven by schema metadata (`renderer:designWireframe`) and rendered via a Floating Panel "Design wireframe" section: controls include label/meta chips, text/media previews, depth fade, optional edges, and label-collision avoidance. These knobs are schema-only; the UI is a thin shell and remains host/URL-agnostic.
- Agent-native video export is owned by `canvas/src/features/design/designAgentVideoSpec.ts` and the existing HTML-video renderer. Design derives semantic HTML, CSS, seekable timing attributes, virtual workspace files, composition rows, source-derived assets, timeline lanes, and data from the active graph, selected layer ids, and shared design-token summaries, then routes the generated renderer flow node through `runHtmlVideoFlowNode` with `createHtmlVideoEngineRegistryFromRuntimeConfig()`. Actual MP4 generation still requires a registered runtime adapter such as the browser-native `canvas-2d` adapter; there is no hardcoded fallback engine or upstream design-tool runtime dependency.

### Media (2D Rich Media + Video Sequence)

- Best for source-backed rich media inspection and video-sequence preview without forking Timeline ownership.
- Media canvas reuses the shared rich-media inventory and `RichMediaPanel`; video-sequence sources come from `kgVideoSequenceSources`, resolve through the runtime source registry, and must not persist stale blob URLs.
- Media preview playback and Timeline playback state share the same document transport/controller path; media-preview surfaces must not fork transport state or read store internals directly.
- BottomPanel `Timeline` owns video-sequence transport, playhead, cut/splice controls, selected-clip nudge/trim/snap/split editing, luma waveform, chroma vectorscope, histogram, audio waveform/mix monitors, lane slots, and source-backed Mermaid Gantt writeback. Clip edits operate on the grouped source lanes so video, mask, grade, and audio timing remains aligned.
- FloatingPanel `Timeline` remains the parsed row/list editor for Timeline or Gantt-Timeline frontmatter. It must not mount the BottomPanel transport shell.
- Cut/splice playback sync maps transport minutes to source media seconds through the compiled sequence plan, including gaps, repeated source segments, masks, grades, transitions, filters, adjustment layers, keyframes, effects, speed rows, images, scenes, and audio lanes.
- Local absolute-path video imports may resolve as `/@fs...` runtime URLs; successful metadata probes must complete without abort-noise cleanup, and repeated imports of the same source should preserve a stable visible media element instead of remounting identical playback surfaces.
- Edited-media export is a derived browser-media surface, not a fourth authoring owner: it reuses the compiled sequence plan plus shared source/metadata helpers, renders through neutral browser media APIs (`captureStream`, `MediaRecorder`, `createMediaElementSource`), and downloads through the shared delayed-revoke blob helper. Successful source probes must stay bound on the success path here too, so export does not reintroduce `@fs` abort churn that preview/import already eliminated. Export teardown is finalized through one shared shutdown path that still stops tracks, disconnects Web Audio, closes `AudioContext`, and clears the video element even if recorder stop/error rejects. Long-running exports also report shared preparing/rendering/finalizing progress labels and honor shared abort/cancel semantics, so BottomPanel controls do not invent panel-local progress state or cancellation behavior. That progress contract is structured upstream: helpers expose `kind`, `phase`, `percentage`, `completedSegments`, and `totalSegments`, while visible labels remain derived presentation rather than the transport format itself. Export-plan validity is shared too: empty plans or plans without any positive-duration source range must fail before recorder/runtime work starts, and BottomPanel export enablement must reuse the same upstream validator. Export error taxonomy is shared as well: abort, capability, plan, source, and runtime failures must resolve through shared export error codes/messages and feedback mapping so surfaces reuse one canonical message contract instead of trimming or inventing local fallback copy. Export outcomes are shared too: successful downloads, cancellations, and failures should surface one structured upstream outcome with canonical message, toast kind, filename, and error-code data so post-export feedback stays renderer-agnostic. Export telemetry is shared too: progress and terminal outcome should emit through one structured event envelope so future surfaces, logs, and history subscribe once instead of forking progress callbacks from outcome callbacks. Export run snapshots are shared too: each run should reduce those events into one bounded session record keyed by run id plus filename-base/kind metadata, preserving timing, progress, and terminal outcome for future history/retry/audit surfaces. Export replay is shared too: retries must resolve through one upstream stale-plan-safe request helper that only replays when the current compiled plan matches the previous run snapshot and no other export is active. Retry surfacing is shared too: BottomPanel should render one latest-session retry control from the shared retry-control helper, using generic disabled copy when no retryable run exists and session-kind-specific copy only when replay is truly available. Recent export rendering is shared too: BottomPanel should render bounded run history through one upstream session-surface model that owns detail labels, empty-state copy, and per-run retry affordances instead of formatting history rows locally. Recent export styling is shared too: run rows should expose upstream tone/style semantics for running, downloaded, cancelled, and failed states so future surfaces reuse one status-to-style contract instead of local class mapping. Recent export selection is shared too: surfaces should choose visible runs through one upstream ordering/filter helper that can prioritize the latest retryable run, keep active runs visible, filter statuses, and then fall back to recency.

## Parity SSOT (Must Match Across Variants)

### 1) Display Graph Derivation

- All variants must derive render inputs from the same display-graph derivation and filtering rules.
- Derivation should output:
  - Display nodes/edges arrays
  - Id lookup maps/sets
  - Group/cluster envelopes (when enabled)

### 2) Fit/Center/Zoom Contract

- Fit must operate on the collective visible graph (post filter/collapse), not per-node centering.
- Initialization must be idempotent:
  - If a valid stored transform is applied, do not also auto-fit in the same init pass.
  - Bounds guard: do not apply stale transforms until graph bounds are computable.
- Initialization group envelopes must derive from the same display-graph AABBs across D3, Flowchart, Flow, Design, and Flow Editor; Flow Editor extends these envelopes with zoom-aware pinned widget overlay extents so panels remain contained inside cluster/subgraph/layer borders on first paint.

### 3) Layer Stack Ordering

- Centralize 2D z-order ranks so groups/edges/nodes/labels/handles stack consistently.

### 4) Selection Semantics

- Selection applies the same rules in all variants:
  - Node/edge selection, multi-select, hover, and selection zoom behavior.
  - Selection updates must avoid restarting layouts/simulations.
- Multi-select and marquee semantics are SSOT across D3, Flow, and Design:
  - Click semantics: replace vs toggle selection is driven by the same modifier set (Shift/Cmd/Ctrl) and shared selection store.
  - Marquee/lasso semantics: `selectMode=lasso` uses shared add/remove/replace semantics (`Shift/Cmd/Ctrl` to add, `Alt` to remove, default to replace); lasso selection writes via the same expanded node-selection helper.
- Align/distribute and keyboard nudging share renderer-neutral shortcuts:
  - `Alt+Shift+L/H/R/T/V/B/X/Y` align or distribute selected nodes/frames; operations respect snap-grid settings and update layout caches via shared helpers.
  - Arrow-key nudging uses a shared helper for deltas; when snap-grid is enabled, nudges move by grid-sized steps (with Shift-based multipliers) and `Alt` bypasses snapping. Design frame nudges apply batched position patches; Graph/Flow nudges freeze layouts and persist positions via layout-position caches without re-seeding.

## Performance Strategy

### Budgets

- Frame budget: avoid tick-time work that scales worse than O(N + E) per frame.
- Avoid synchronous heavy work during render/interaction (typing, zoom, pan, selection).

### Hot-Path Rules

- Prefer memoized derivations keyed by topology (revision/hash) and minimal renderer config.
- Gate expensive work by mode and by alpha/idle state.
- Prefer rAF coalescing for DOM updates (selection styling, overlays).

### Rendering Optimizations (Incremental)

- D3 Graph:
  - Reduce per-tick edge endpoint computations and avoid per-edge DOM writes when alpha is low.
  - LOD for labels: hide below scale threshold using schema knobs.
  - Batch style updates for selection/hover.
- Flow/Flow Editor:
  - Cache token reads and text metrics per theme key.
  - Cache glyphs/text layouts where safe.
  - Avoid per-event full redraw if only overlays changed.

## Shared Utilities (Centralize)

- Viewport math: bounds computation, fit transform, zoom quantization.
- Scheduling: debounce/throttle/rAF coalescing.
- Worker RPC: request/response protocol, abort/timeout semantics.
- Perf instrumentation: stage-based measurements and event dispatch (opt-in).

## Cross-Touchpoint Expectations

- Switching between Editor workspace, Graph Data Table, Graph Fields, Props Panel, Markdown surfaces, Explorer, and Canvas Preview:
  - Must not reset layout unexpectedly.
  - Must preserve pinned/fit/selection zoom semantics.
  - Must not cause hidden renderers to consume shared requests.

## Acceptance Criteria (Bounded)

- No upstream design-tool repository URL literals exist in the repository.
- 2D render variants share the same display-graph derivation and fit/zoom initialization contract.
- Switching 2D variants preserves mental map: no chaotic clustering or excessive void-space regressions.
- Design video export builds from source graph/tokens and reuses the HTML-video renderer runtime registry; focused `design.editor.agentVideo.*` tests guard semantic HTML, deterministic motion CSS, seekable timeline data attributes, MP4 preview state, and no copied design-engine/fallback path.
- Bounded validation: focused renderer/parser tests and `npm run typecheck` pass; full `npm run test:ci` remains a release-level gate.
