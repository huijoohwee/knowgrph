# Knowgrph Lark App MCP - PRD/TAD Companion

Implementation-accurate supplement to [knowgrph-lark-app-mcp-prd-tad.md](knowgrph-lark-app-mcp-prd-tad.md).

**Document Version**: 0.1.20
**Date**: 2026-06-06
**Status**: Implementation-aligned supplement

---

## Purpose

This companion turns the Lark app MCP PRD/TAD into a phase-gated implementation checklist for the shipped baseline and the next controlled extensions.

It answers six questions:

1. What is already shipped today for the Lark app -> `knowgrph` Canvas contract?
2. Which repo owners are allowed to change for the implemented baseline?
3. How should the external Lark app `baseinfo` and `webpage` surfaces be treated?
4. What must be true before Canvas-mediated import work begins?
5. What must be true before any remote write or mutation flow is allowed?
6. Which shortcuts are explicitly forbidden across all phases?

## Shipped Vs Planned

| Surface / Phase | Status | Actual / Expected Owner | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 baseline | Shipped baseline | `grph-shared/src/search/larkAppMcpSsot.ts`, `canvas/src/features/panels/views/larkAppMcpApiDocs.ts`, `canvas/src/features/panels/views/settingsMcpDocEntries.ts` | MainPanel MCP documentation surface for Lark app -> deployed MCP -> Canvas |
| Lark app `baseinfo` surface | External operator surface | `https://open.larksuite.com/app/cli_a7ddaa5aeff89010/baseinfo` | App-management page only; not a `knowgrph` MCP endpoint and not a local repo path |
| Lark app `webpage` surface | External operator surface, checklist included | `https://open.larksuite.com/app/cli_a7ddaa5aeff89010/webpage` | Treat as app webpage configuration or launch surface only; it must not replace the deployed MCP endpoint or Canvas validation path |
| Phase 2 next slice | Shipped baseline | `canvas/src/features/canvas/larkAppCanvasHandoff.ts`, `canvas/src/features/canvas/CanvasQueryBootstrapRuntime.tsx`, existing import owners | Canvas-mediated handoff, review, and source import ergonomics now reuse shipped bootstrap and import owners without adding remote mutation |
| Phase 3 runtime slice | Shipped browser-local | `canvas/src/features/canvas/larkAppRemoteMutationBridge.ts`, `canvas/src/features/canvas/larkAppRemoteMutationBridgeRuntime.ts`, `grph-shared/src/search/larkAppMcpSsot.ts`, `canvas/src/features/panels/views/larkAppMcpApiDocs.ts` | Authenticated remote mutation now has a typed contract, a browser-local runtime bridge for the supported import action, a dry-run-only publish preview with explicit target, conflict, audit, next-step, blocked-preview metadata, a stable host handoff manifest, a human-readable preview summary, a machine-readable warning severity, a host handoff checklist, a machine-readable remediation hint, a machine-readable retry disposition, a machine-readable required host capability, a machine-readable required host capability status, a machine-readable required host capability verification method, a machine-readable required host capability verification target, a machine-readable required host capability verification evidence type, and a machine-readable required host capability owner, plus MainPanel guidance, but still no remote write-capable endpoint |

## External Lark Surface Checklist

### Objective

Keep the external Lark app surfaces explicit in the contract without misclassifying them as `knowgrph` endpoints or bypass paths.

### Baseinfo Surface

- [x] `https://open.larksuite.com/app/cli_a7ddaa5aeff89010/baseinfo` is documented as an app-management surface, not a `knowgrph` MCP endpoint
- [x] `baseinfo` is not treated as a Feishu Base URL
- [x] `baseinfo` is not treated as a remote replacement for MainPanel MCP guidance

### Webpage Surface

- [x] Confirm whether `webpage` launches, embeds, or configures an external web experience rather than owning MCP transport itself
- [x] Confirm the `webpage` surface does not replace `https://airvio.co/knowgrph/mcp` as the Lark-side remote MCP target
- [x] Confirm the `webpage` surface does not replace `knowgrph` Canvas as the canonical review/import/visualization surface
- [x] Confirm any future webpage-launched flow still hands off to shipped `knowgrph` runtime owners instead of a parallel graph or import stack

### Allowed Change Types

- [x] Add explicit Canvas handoff or deep-link guidance for Lark-driven workflows
- [x] Add webpage-launch or app-handoff documentation only if it reuses existing Canvas/runtime owners
- [x] Add thin runtime affordances that call the existing Feishu Base import seam
- [x] Add focused tests for handoff visibility, import entry conditions, and non-secret defaults
- [x] Update docs to describe how the `webpage` surface should hand off into Canvas if that flow is adopted

### Required Conditions

- [x] Canvas remains the canonical review/import/visualization surface
- [x] The `webpage` surface, if used, acts only as a launch or configuration surface and not as a second import or graph runtime
- [x] Existing Feishu Base source adapter and import command remain the only Base snapshot import path
- [x] Existing validation owners remain the only path to graph materialization
- [x] Any operator handoff from Lark to Canvas is explicit, documented, and reversible
- [x] No direct Lark or webpage payload reaches graph store or canvas-apply owners

### Webpage Handoff Checklist

- [x] Define whether `https://open.larksuite.com/app/cli_a7ddaa5aeff89010/webpage` opens `knowgrph` directly or configures a separate launch artifact
- [x] Define what URL, route, or query parameters the webpage surface is allowed to pass into `knowgrph`
- [x] Define whether the handoff is read-only, review-only, or import-capable
- [x] Define how operator identity and auth context are preserved without storing secrets in browser state
- [x] Define failure behavior when Canvas is unavailable or the handoff payload is invalid
- [x] Define how the handoff avoids introducing a second docs/config SSOT outside MainPanel and the PRD/TAD

### Focused Validation

- [x] Canvas handoff is visible and operator-understandable
- [x] Webpage-launched flows do not bypass validation/import owners
- [x] Base snapshot import still routes through the existing runtime command and adapter
- [x] No remote mutation behavior is mixed into the Canvas handoff work

### Phase 2 Exit Gate

- [x] Canvas-mediated handoff for Lark-driven review/import is documented and implemented through existing owners
- [x] Existing import and validation owners remain authoritative
- [x] All focused tests for Phase 2 pass
- [x] No remote write or mutation logic is mixed into this phase

---

## Phase 3 Checklist

### Objective

Add an authenticated remote mutation bridge only if the product needs server-mediated import or write-back without opening Canvas.

### Allowed Change Types

- [x] Add a dedicated remote bridge owner for authenticated write/import actions
- [x] Add typed publish or mutation payloads and response handling
- [x] Add idempotency, conflict, and audit rules
- [x] Add focused tests for mutation-only behavior and failure isolation

### Required Conditions

- [x] Remote mutation requires explicit operator or workflow intent
- [x] Write failures do not corrupt workspace or graph state
- [x] Permissions, conflict handling, and audit boundaries are documented before rollout
- [x] The `webpage` surface does not become an undocumented write-capable mutation shortcut

### Publish And Mutation Contract Checklist

- [x] Define authenticated caller identity and token ownership

- [x] Define conflict and overwrite policy
- [x] Define audit/logging expectations
- [x] Define rollback behavior for partial remote failures
- [x] Define how the remote bridge reuses existing source adaptation, validation, and promotion owners

### Focused Validation

- [x] No write-back is triggered during read-only or review-only flows
- [x] No write-back is embedded in MainPanel docs rows, webpage-launch configuration, or parser owners
- [x] Failed remote mutation leaves graph state unchanged
- [x] Successful remote mutation remains observable and auditable at the browser-local runtime layer
- [x] Dry-run publish preview validates the contract locally without applying remote write-back
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns explicit target metadata without implying that write-back succeeded
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns conflict, audit, and next-step metadata for host-managed follow-up without implying that write-back succeeded
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns an explicit blocked-preview state and canonical blocking reason while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a stable host handoff manifest for downstream host-managed orchestration while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a stable human-readable summary for host-side display while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable warning severity for host-side branching while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a host handoff checklist for downstream operational follow-up while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable remediation hint for canonical blocked-preview follow-up while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable retry disposition so blocked publish callers avoid local retry loops while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable required host capability so blocked publish callers can verify endpoint readiness before retry or apply while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable required host capability status so blocked publish callers can distinguish requirement from current browser-local availability while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable required host capability verification method so blocked publish callers know how to verify host readiness while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable required host capability verification target so blocked publish callers know which readiness target the host must confirm while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable required host capability verification evidence type so blocked publish callers know which host-reported signal must satisfy readiness while remote publish remains deferred
- [x] Dry-run publish preview returns a machine-readable required host capability owner so blocked publish callers can route follow-up to the responsible host-side owner while remote publish remains deferred

### Phase 3 Exit Gate

- [x] Authenticated remote mutation operates as a controlled, explicit browser-local runtime slice
- [x] Ownership is clear and conflict-aware
- [x] All focused tests for the Phase 3 contract slice pass
- [x] No hidden coupling to MainPanel, webpage-launch, Canvas apply, or validation owners exists
- [x] Live browser-local runtime bridge is limited to the supported import action plus dry-run-only publish preview
- [x] Live write-capable remote endpoint remains deferred to a later rollout
