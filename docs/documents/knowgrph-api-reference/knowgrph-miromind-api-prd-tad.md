# PRD + TAD - Knowgrph x MiroMind API Integration

> **Scope**: Maintain `MiroMind API` in MainPanel `Integrations`, align MainPanel `MCP` guidance, and keep the existing browser-local chat -> workspace markdown -> canvas pipeline as the only downstream graph-application route.  
> **Lens**: universal, neutral, upstream-first, no duplicate pipelines, no renderer forks, no legacy shims.  
> **Repo truth**: shared `SettingsView` remains the owner for MainPanel `integrations` and `mcp`; frontmatter-first markdown remains the only canonical payload that applies to canvas.

# Part A - PRD

## 1. Current Repo Truth

Knowgrph already ships the core end-to-end path that MiroMind must reuse:

- MainPanel `integrations` and MainPanel `mcp` are thin shells over the shared `SettingsView` owner.
- Shared settings/chat readiness already route provider, model, auth, and integration state through `useSettingsChatAssist` and normalized `integrationConfigsJson`.
- FloatingPanel Chat already owns the runtime chat surface and submit lifecycle.
- The prompt stack already layers a strict base KGC contract, packed graph/workspace context, optional selection/workspace prompts, and conversation history.
- `chatKnowgrph` already requires one frontmatter-first KGC markdown document as output.
- Validation, retry, recovery, finalize, workspace follow, and canvas apply already run on the saved markdown document.
- YAML frontmatter remains the single source of truth for canvas presets and downstream renderer/view state.
- Canvas view modes and 2D renderers already project from shared frontmatter and graph state; they must not become MiroMind-specific.

## 2. Problem Statement

Knowgrph now has a repo-accurate MiroMind baseline across the real shipped surfaces.

Current implemented baseline:

1. MainPanel `Integrations` documents and exposes `MiroMind API` through the same shared settings owner used by other providers.
2. MainPanel `MCP` explains how MiroMind's optional `mcp_servers` capability relates to the existing Knowgrph MCP/readiness surfaces.
3. The runtime path is the existing `SettingsView` -> FloatingPanel Chat -> Workspace markdown -> Canvas path.
4. MiroMind reasoning-step streaming is additive transport/parser capability inside the existing chat request pipeline, not a second graph materialization path.

## 3. Product Goal

Maintain MiroMind in a way that preserves one upstream-to-downstream contract:

- Upstream provider readiness and configuration live in shared MainPanel settings owners.
- Chat orchestration stays inside FloatingPanel Chat and the existing submit coordinator stack.
- Output stays one canonical KGC markdown document when `chatStorageTarget=chatKnowgrph`.
- Workspace editor remains the canonical persistence/follow surface.
- Canvas applies only from the saved markdown document and its frontmatter.
- Renderer/view mode switches remain provider-neutral projections over shared graph state.

## 4. Non-Goals

- No new standalone MiroMind panel shell.
- No direct LLM-output -> graph mutation bypass.
- No MiroMind-specific renderer, widget, rich-media, subgraph, or edge schema.
- No backward-compat alias layer for legacy grouping keys or alternate graph payloads.
- No browser-persisted MiroMind secrets.
- No prod-only doc edits outside the `knowgrph` source tree.

## 5. Personas

### Persona A - Workspace Operator

Needs to configure MiroMind from MainPanel, run chat from the existing FloatingPanel surface, and land usable markdown/frontmatter into canvas without learning a second workflow.

### Persona B - Pipeline Maintainer

Needs MiroMind to stay additive at shared owners and transport/parser seams, with no downstream patches, no renderer churn, and no duplicate contracts.

### Persona C - Agent / MCP Operator

Needs clear guidance on the difference between MainPanel `Integrations` provider readiness and MainPanel `MCP` documentation for optional remote `mcp_servers` capability.

## 6. User Journey

| Stage | User action | Surface | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discover | Opens MainPanel `integrations` | `SettingsView` | Sees `MiroMind API` through shared section metadata; no new shell |
| Configure | Sets provider, endpoint, auth, model, context scope | shared chat/settings rows | Reuses normalized settings/chat owner and shared readiness snapshots |
| Understand | Opens MainPanel `mcp` | shared settings docs | Sees that MiroMind `mcp_servers` is optional/provider-side and must not fork runtime ownership |
| Run | Opens FloatingPanel Chat and submits request | `FloatingPanelChat` | Existing submit coordinator composes prompts, transport, streaming, validation, finalize |
| Persist | Receives `chatKnowgrph` output | Workspace Editor | One canonical `kgc_*.md` document is written/followed |
| Apply | Applies saved markdown/frontmatter | Canvas | Shared `setActiveMarkdownDocument()` path applies frontmatter and graph |
| Explore | Switches canvas view mode / 2D renderer | Toolbar / Canvas | D3 Graph, Flowchart, Flow Canvas, Animatic, Storyboard, and Design all remain projections of the same graph |

## 7. Epics, Stories, Acceptance Criteria

### Epic MM-E1 - Keep MiroMind In MainPanel Integrations

**Story MM-E1-S1 - Shared settings owner exposes MiroMind API**

> As a workspace operator, I want `MiroMind API` to appear in MainPanel `Integrations`, so that I configure it through the same shared settings surface as other providers.

Acceptance criteria:

- Given MainPanel opens on `integrations`, when integration sections render, then `MiroMind API` appears through shared `SettingsView` metadata and not through a new custom panel shell.
- Given MiroMind rows render, when values change, then provider/model/auth/routing state flows through existing shared settings/chat owners and normalized config surfaces rather than provider-specific ad hoc state.
- Given local settings readiness is inspected, when MiroMind is selected, then readiness snapshots and documentation continue to flow from existing browser-local snapshot owners.

`/goal MainPanel Integrations adds MiroMind through shared settings metadata, shared chat assist owners, and normalized config/state surfaces only`

### Epic MM-E2 - Align MainPanel MCP Without Forking Runtime

**Story MM-E2-S1 - MainPanel MCP explains MiroMind MCP capability neutrally**

> As an agent operator, I want MainPanel `MCP` to document MiroMind's optional `mcp_servers` capability, so that I understand the capability without assuming a second runtime path.

Acceptance criteria:

- Given MainPanel opens on `mcp`, when MiroMind is documented, then the text states that `mcp_servers` is an optional provider capability and remains distinct from Knowgrph's own MCP runtime/readiness surfaces.
- Given the user reads MainPanel `mcp`, when runtime ownership is described, then the doc points back to the same FloatingPanel Chat -> Workspace markdown -> Canvas pipeline and forbids an MCP-only graph materialization path.
- Given `mcp_servers` is private beta or unsupported for a plan tier, when the user reads the docs, then the integration remains usable through the base chat-completions path without runtime ambiguity.

`/goal MainPanel MCP adds MiroMind guidance as documentation/readiness context only and does not introduce a second E2E contract`

### Epic MM-E3 - Preserve One Chat-to-Canvas Contract

**Story MM-E3-S1 - MiroMind reuses the existing chat pipeline**

> As a pipeline maintainer, I want MiroMind to reuse the existing FloatingPanel Chat pipeline, so that chat output keeps landing in workspace markdown before any canvas apply occurs.

Acceptance criteria:

- Given a MiroMind-backed request is submitted, when prompts are assembled, then the base KGC contract, packed context, optional selection/workspace prompts, and conversation history remain the canonical prompt layers.
- Given `chatStorageTarget=chatKnowgrph`, when the model answers, then the answer is still exactly one frontmatter-first KGC markdown document and not prose plus sidecar graph JSON.
- Given finalize succeeds, when graph state changes, then the active workspace markdown document remains the only graph-application payload; direct raw-stream or UI-local graph mutation is forbidden.

`/goal MiroMind stays inside the existing FloatingPanelChat submit/request/validation/finalize chain and preserves markdown-first graph application`

### Epic MM-E4 - Additive Reasoning Stream Support

**Story MM-E4-S1 - MiroMind reasoning steps surface without replacing the transport shell**

> As a workspace operator, I want MiroMind reasoning steps to be observable, so that I can inspect deep-research progress without giving up the existing chat runtime.

Acceptance criteria:

- Given MiroMind streams SSE chunks, when `delta.reasoning_steps` arrives, then parsing/rendering is implemented as an additive raw-HTTP/SSE capability in the existing request/streaming stack.
- Given streaming completes, when finish/usage metadata arrives, then usage, reasoning-token, and search-query fields remain provider metadata attached to the same chat run rather than a separate session system.
- Given providers that do not expose `reasoning_steps`, when the shared chat pipeline runs, then the shared transport still works without branching the markdown/output contract.

`/goal MiroMind streaming extensions remain additive transport/parser support under the shared chat shell and never fork the output contract`

### Epic MM-E5 - Preserve Frontmatter and Renderer Neutrality

**Story MM-E5-S1 - Canvas and renderer contracts remain provider-neutral**

> As a renderer maintainer, I want MiroMind provenance to stay upstream in prompts/metadata, so that Storyboard, Animatic, Design, Flow Canvas, Flowchart, and D3 Graph stay neutral projections of shared graph state.

Acceptance criteria:

- Given a MiroMind-generated markdown file is applied, when frontmatter presets are parsed, then shared canvas/frontmatter owners remain authoritative for surface mode, render mode, and 2D renderer mode.
- Given nodes, widgets, rich media panels, subgraphs/groups/clusters, and edges are rendered, when provider provenance exists, then it is carried as metadata within the shared document/graph contract and not as renderer-specific branch logic.
- Given grouping is authored, when the markdown is validated, then canonical grouping ownership remains unchanged and no duplicate grouping channels or legacy aliases are introduced.

`/goal MiroMind affects upstream provider metadata only; renderer/view-layer ownership remains unchanged and provider-neutral`

## 8. MoSCoW

| Priority | Item | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Must | Add `MiroMind API` to MainPanel `Integrations` via shared owners | Core discoverability with minimal churn |
| Must | Align MainPanel `MCP` docs to optional `mcp_servers` capability | Prevent runtime confusion and duplicate pipeline assumptions |
| Must | Keep chat -> markdown -> workspace -> canvas as the only E2E graph path | Preserves SSOT and avoids downstream patches |
| Must | Keep renderer/view mode contracts provider-neutral | Prevents churn across canvas surfaces |
| Should | Surface reasoning-step and usage metadata through shared streaming stack | Adds MiroMind-specific value without architectural drift |
| Should | Add source-to-publish deployment guidance for docs | Prevents dev/prod/cloudflare divergence |
| Could | Add provider-specific prompt helper fragment for MiroMind capability hints | Useful, but only if it stays subordinate to base KGC contract |
| Won't | Add a standalone MiroMind graph ingestion runtime | Explicitly forbidden |

## 9. Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|---|---|---|
| MainPanel Integrations provider discoverability | implemented MiroMind row | one shared-owner MiroMind area |
| Duplicate chat/graph pipeline count | 0 | exactly 0 |
| Direct LLM-output -> graph bypasses | possible by ambiguity | exactly 0 |
| Renderer-specific provider branches | at risk by poor design | exactly 0 |
| Publish-surface doc divergence | possible | source-owned only in `knowgrph` |

## 10. Scope Boundaries

In scope now:

- Repo-accurate PRD/TAD for MiroMind integration.
- MainPanel `Integrations` owner alignment.
- MainPanel `MCP` guidance alignment.
- Prompt/output/frontmatter/canvas contract alignment.
- Dev -> prod -> Cloudflare doc-publish topology notes.

Explicitly excluded now:

- Implementing a second runtime surface for MiroMind.
- Inventing a provider-specific markdown schema.
- Writing prod-only docs directly under published output without syncing from source.
- Adding stale compatibility code for legacy group aliases, duplicate payloads, or parallel transport contracts.

---

# Part B - TAD

## 11. Architecture Principles

1. Shared owners first: `MainPanel` tabs stay thin; `SettingsView` remains the owner for `integrations` and `mcp`.
2. One canonical artifact: the saved workspace markdown document is the only payload that may apply to graph/canvas.
3. Provider-neutral renderers: all canvas views consume shared graph/frontmatter state and never branch by provider.
4. Additive provider capability: MiroMind-specific behavior belongs in settings metadata, prompt assembly extensions, and streaming/parser support only.
5. Upstream neutralization: prevent duplicate state, duplicate schemas, legacy aliases, and local downstream patches instead of compensating for them later.

## 12. Canonical E2E Path

| Phase | Canonical owner | Output |
|---|---|---|
| MainPanel route | `MainPanel` -> `IntegrationsHubView` / `McpHubView` -> `SettingsView` | shared provider/readiness surface |
| Provider config | `useSettingsChatAssist` + normalized settings values | provider/model/auth/context selection |
| Floating chat | `FloatingPanelChat` | chat UI + request lifecycle |
| Prompt assembly | `floatingPanelChatSubmitRequest.ts` + `chatContextPack.ts` + base contract prompts | ordered system/user/assistant messages |
| Transport | shared chat request sender | streaming HTTP response |
| Validation / recovery | `chatMarkdownValidation.ts` + KGC retry helpers | canonical KGC markdown candidate |
| Finalize / persist | `useFinalizeAssistantSuccess.ts` | saved `kgc_*.md` workspace document |
| Canvas apply | `chatKgcCanvasApply.ts` -> `applyWorkspaceImportToCanvas()` -> `setActiveMarkdownDocument()` | Source Files materialization + frontmatter preset apply + markdown-to-graph apply |
| Storyboard Widget text/transcript run | `useStoryboardWidgetWorkflowActions.ts` -> `writeTextWidgetRunOutputArtifact()` -> `applyWorkspaceImportToCanvas({ applyToGraph: false })` | passive sibling workspace Markdown artifact plus shared widget/Rich Media Panel `outputPath` |
| Storyboard Widget image/video run | `useStoryboardWidgetWorkflowActions.ts` -> `writeRichMediaWidgetRunOutputArtifact()` -> `applyWorkspaceImportToCanvas({ applyToGraph: false })` | generated binary sibling artifact, R2-backed storage route when runtime sync is enabled, passive editable Markdown manifest, and shared widget/Rich Media Panel `outputPath` / `outputManifestPath` |
| View/render | toolbar view state + renderer/frontmatter owners | provider-neutral canvas projections |

## 13. Owner Map

| Surface | Owner | MiroMind rule |
|---|---|---|
| MainPanel `integrations` | shared `SettingsView` metadata and rows | add MiroMind here; do not add a new shell |
| MainPanel `mcp` | shared settings docs/readiness rows | document optional `mcp_servers`; do not fork runtime |
| Integration config | normalized `integrationConfigsJson` and shared chat values | extend existing normalized config; no ad hoc per-provider state |
| Chat contract | `chatResponseBaseContract.ts` | base KGC contract remains authoritative |
| Context pack | `chatContextPack.ts` | selected node, edges, frontmatter, graph summary, guideline digest stay unchanged |
| Submit coordinator | `floatingPanelChatSubmitCoordinator.ts` stack | MiroMind rides the existing lifecycle |
| Validation | `chatMarkdownValidation.ts` | same markdown/frontmatter rules apply |
| Workspace persistence | workspace markdown runtime | saved document stays canonical |
| Canvas/frontmatter | `frontmatter.ts`, `canvasFrontmatterPreset.ts`, graph-data actions | same preset and graph-apply rules apply |

## 14. MiroMind Provider Contract

### 14.1 Runtime positioning

MiroMind is an additive chat provider capability on the existing shared chat request path. It must not become a parallel assistant runtime.

### 14.2 Endpoint contract

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `https://api.miromind.ai/v1` |
| Primary endpoint | `POST /chat/completions` |
| Models | `mirothinker-1-7-deepresearch-mini`, `mirothinker-1-7-deepresearch` |
| Auth | Server-managed `MIROMIND_API_KEY` from Cloudflare Pages `context.env`, or memory-only BYOK on explicit fallback |
| Stream mode | SSE, `stream: true` |
| Optional capability | `mcp_servers` request field, provider-side, private beta / plan-dependent |

### 14.3 Shared request envelope

The request must continue to use the existing chat submit shell:

```json
{
  "model": "mirothinker-1-7-deepresearch-mini",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "<base KGC or generic contract>" },
    { "role": "system", "content": "<packed context>" },
    { "role": "system", "content": "<optional selection/workspace prompts>" },
    { "role": "user", "content": "<conversation turn>" }
  ],
  "stream": true,
  "max_tokens": 4000
}
```

Rules:

- The MiroMind integration may add provider-specific headers/options upstream, but must not replace the shared message assembly order.
- If `mcp_servers` is later enabled, it remains optional provider metadata on the same request envelope.
- MiroMind-specific prompt additions must remain subordinate to the base KGC contract and must never redefine the output schema.

## 15. Prompt Contract Layering

Prompt layering remains canonical and ordered:

1. Base contract prompt from `chatResponseBaseContract.ts`
2. Packed context prompt from `chatContextPack.ts`
3. Optional bounded graph selection prompt
4. Optional workspace-wide context prompt
5. Optional user-supplied system prompt
6. Conversation history

MiroMind-specific guidance may be inserted only as an additive provider hint between steps 2-5 if needed, and only when it does all of the following:

- preserves the base frontmatter-first KGC output contract,
- does not duplicate context already emitted by shared owners,
- does not hardcode project-specific schema forks,
- does not instruct direct graph mutation or renderer-specific behavior.

## 16. Streaming Contract

### 16.1 Why raw SSE matters

MiroMind exposes reasoning-step extensions such as `delta.reasoning_steps` and final usage metadata including reasoning tokens and search query counts. OpenAI-compatible SDK wrappers may hide or drop extension fields, so reasoning visibility requires raw HTTP/SSE parsing inside the shared streaming shell.

### 16.2 Allowed additive behavior

- Parse `delta.reasoning_steps` when present.
- Parse `delta.content` for final answer tokens, including provider-compatible structured text parts.
- Keep reasoning-only streams visible as reasoning metadata without promoting them to final assistant content.
- Parse terminal `finish_reason` and `usage`.
- Ignore MiroMind-specific fields gracefully when not present.

### 16.3 Forbidden behavior

- No second streaming client stack that bypasses shared chat lifecycle owners.
- No provider-specific finalize path that skips markdown validation/persistence.
- No direct reasoning-step -> graph mutation logic.

## 17. Output Contract

### 17.1 Canonical `chatKnowgrph` output

When the storage target is `chatKnowgrph`, the assistant output must still be exactly one standalone frontmatter-first KGC markdown document.

Required invariants:

- First chunk begins with `---`.
- No wrapper prose before or after the document.
- One saved canonical `kgc_*.md` document remains the artifact that Workspace and Canvas follow.
- Graph-application payload equals the saved markdown document, not a derived provider payload.
- The saved document lands in Source Files before active-document apply so Storyboard Card/Widget, Rich Media Panels, and Edges read the same renderer-neutral data.
- Storyboard Widget text/transcript widget runs that have an active workspace document persist one sibling Markdown artifact and register it in Source Files passively. Storyboard Widget image/video widget runs persist the binary artifact, store bytes through the R2-backed storage route when runtime sync is enabled, create one editable Markdown manifest, and register that manifest in Source Files passively; provider output must not bypass the shared widget or Rich Media Panel patch owners.

### 17.2 Provenance handling

MiroMind provenance may appear only as upstream metadata within the shared document/graph contract, for example:

- source/provider identifiers,
- cited URLs or source notes,
- usage or reasoning summaries,
- session IDs tied to saved markdown history.

It must not introduce:

- provider-specific node types,
- provider-specific edge schemas,
- alternate grouping registries,
- renderer-only metadata that changes graph semantics.

## 18. Workspace and Frontmatter Contract

| Contract point | Required rule |
|---|---|
| Workspace artifact | canonical `kgc_*.md` file is the saved truth |
| Validation gate | same KGC structural rules apply regardless of provider |
| Frontmatter parsing | same shared YAML/frontmatter parser remains authoritative |
| Canvas preset apply | same preset fields drive surface mode, render mode, and 2D renderer |
| Graph apply | same workspace import and markdown-to-graph path runs through Source Files and active markdown document actions |
| Widget run artifacts | same workspace artifact writers and passive Source Files registration path persist completed text/transcript outputs plus image/video manifests |
| Renderer behavior | D3 Graph, Flowchart, Flow Canvas, Animatic, Storyboard, and Design remain view projections only |

## 19. MainPanel MCP Alignment

MainPanel `MCP` must explain MiroMind neutrally:

- MiroMind `mcp_servers` is a provider-side request capability, not a replacement for Knowgrph MCP.
- Knowgrph's browser/local MCP readiness surfaces remain separate shared owners.
- MiroMind MCP capability, when available, still feeds the same chat -> markdown -> workspace -> canvas chain.
- If unavailable, the base MiroMind chat-completions path still works and remains the default contract.

## 20. Deployment and Publish Topology

Documentation ownership must stay aligned across the publish chain:

| Stage | Path | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Source of truth | `/Users/huijoohwee/Documents/GitHub/knowgrph/docs/documents/...` | edit here only |
| Published content | `/Users/huijoohwee/Documents/GitHub/huijoohwee/content/knowgrph` | generated/synced output only |
| Cloudflare route | `https://airvio.co/knowgrph` | serves published output; no manual hotfix divergence |

Guardrails:

- Do not maintain separate hand-edited prod-only copies of this integration spec.
- Source edits in `knowgrph` must be the upstream authority for any later publish/sync step.
- MainPanel docs, generated references, and published docs must describe the same single runtime contract.

## 21. ADRs

### ADR-01 - One markdown artifact over direct graph mutation

**Decision**: keep the saved workspace markdown document as the sole graph-application payload.

**Rationale**:

- preserves SSOT,
- keeps Workspace follow/debugging intact,
- prevents transport/UI-local graph drift,
- avoids provider-specific canvas mutation code.

### ADR-02 - Raw SSE parsing over SDK-only streaming for MiroMind reasoning visibility

**Decision**: use raw HTTP/SSE parsing inside the shared transport shell when MiroMind reasoning extensions are needed.

**Rationale**:

- preserves access to `reasoning_steps` and extended usage fields,
- keeps one transport lifecycle,
- avoids a parallel provider-specific runtime.

### ADR-03 - MainPanel MCP documents optional provider capability, not a second pipeline

**Decision**: document `mcp_servers` as optional provider capability in MainPanel `MCP`, but keep runtime ownership with the shared chat pipeline.

**Rationale**:

- prevents operator confusion,
- keeps Knowgrph MCP and provider-side MCP concerns separated,
- avoids duplicate E2E claims.

## 22. Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Requirement | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Neutrality | no renderer/provider forks | code and docs show one shared downstream path |
| SSOT | one saved markdown artifact owns apply | inspect finalize/apply path and docs |
| Observability | reasoning/usage can surface without contract drift | shared stream parser captures additive fields |
| Stability | provider differences do not alter markdown schema | same validation rules pass/fail regardless of provider |
| Deployability | source-owned docs publish cleanly to prod/cloudflare | source and published docs stay in sync |

## Traceability

| Story | Owner | Interface | `/goal` |
|---|---|---|---|
| MM-E1-S1 | shared `SettingsView` and settings chat assist owners | MainPanel `integrations` -> normalized config/readiness | MiroMind appears only through shared settings owners |
| MM-E2-S1 | shared MainPanel `mcp` docs/readiness surface | MainPanel `mcp` -> MiroMind MCP guidance | no second E2E runtime contract appears |
| MM-E3-S1 | submit/request/validation/finalize chain | chat messages -> markdown -> workspace -> canvas | saved markdown remains sole apply payload |
| MM-E4-S1 | shared raw HTTP/SSE parser path | streaming delta/usage parsing | reasoning visibility stays additive and transport-local |
| MM-E5-S1 | frontmatter and renderer owners | markdown/frontmatter -> graph -> renderers | canvas views remain provider-neutral |

## Validation Checklist

- Add `MiroMind API` only through shared MainPanel settings metadata and shared config/readiness owners.
- Keep `miromindApi.api_key` defaulted to `Server-managed Key`; Pages must provide `MIROMIND_API_KEY` through runtime `context.env` after a deployment created with that secret.
- Keep MainPanel `MCP` documentation descriptive and neutral; do not imply a new runtime.
- Keep prompt layering canonical; do not replace the base KGC contract.
- Keep `chatKnowgrph` output as one frontmatter-first KGC markdown document.
- Keep the saved workspace markdown document as the only graph-application payload.
- Keep frontmatter/canvas preset parsing unchanged and provider-neutral.
- Keep renderer/view-mode behavior unchanged across D3 Graph, Flowchart, Flow Canvas, Animatic, Storyboard, and Design.
- Run `npm --prefix canvas run test:smoke:miromind:source` for the focused source-owned gate covering the rendered MainPanel path and server-managed key contract without live Pages dependencies.
- Run `npm run miromind:readiness:check` for the non-deploy gate covering that source smoke, Pages secret listing, and live no-BYOK proxy smoke.
- Forbid direct LLM-output -> graph mutation bypasses.
- Forbid duplicate grouping registries, legacy aliases, and provider-specific schema forks.
- Forbid browser-persisted secrets and prod-only doc divergence.

## Explicit Forbiddens

- No MiroMind-only panel shell.
- No MiroMind-only markdown schema.
- No provider-local graph patch layer.
- No duplicate prompt contract that shadows `chatResponseBaseContract.ts`.
- No separate MCP-only canvas materialization path.
- No stale compatibility branch for legacy grouping or alternate graph payloads.
- No direct edits in published prod copies without source sync.
