# Media node panels
- Panel-only mode hides base circle/rect glyphs for media-capable nodes and
  renders standalone media panels.
- Each Media Node panel has a header strip that shows the node label and type
  inline in the form `Label (Type)`.
- Compact vs Standard density:
  - Compact panels use the minimap size as their base:
    - Height equals `MINIMAP_HEIGHT` (fixed).
    - Width is derived from height using a 16:9 aspect ratio:
      - `MINIMAP_WIDTH = round(MINIMAP_HEIGHT * 16 / 9)`.
  - Standard panels are tuned against maximum zoom:
    - Panel geometry is chosen so that at `ZOOM_MAX` (canvas max zoom-in)
      the visible Standard panel is ~`1.5 × MINIMAP_WIDTH` wide and
      ~`1.5 × MINIMAP_HEIGHT` tall on screen.
- The minimap dimensions and zoom bounds are defined once via:
  - `MINIMAP_WIDTH`, `MINIMAP_HEIGHT`, and `ZOOM_MAX` in
    `canvas/src/features/minimap/math.ts`.
- On the 2D canvas:
  - Panel geometry is expressed in graph units and scaled by the current
    zoom transform.
  - At maximum zoom, Standard panels visually match the “2× minimap”
    sizing; at lower zoom levels they scale down proportionally.
- Media URL behavior:
  - Node media URLs are normalized by `getNodeMediaSpec` in
    `canvas/src/components/GraphCanvas/helpers.ts`.
  - Image and video URLs are passed through `applyMediaProxySrc` so that
    cross-origin HTTP(S) media is fetched via `/__fetch_remote`.

# Media panel visual QA checklist
- Zoom behavior:
  - On initial load, confirm the canvas opens with Fit to Screen enabled:
    - The graph is centered in the viewport.
    - All visible nodes fit within the canvas with a small margin.
  - With Fit to Screen enabled, adding the first node to an empty canvas
    should produce a centered node: the new node should appear in the middle
    of the viewport (even if its simulation coordinates are offset) and
    subsequent nodes should remain inside the full-graph frame.
  - Toggle the toolbar “Fit to Screen” button off and on:
    - Off: viewport stays where it is while zoom/pan controls work normally.
    - On: viewport recenters on the full graph in 2D and 3D modes.
  - Use canvas zoom controls to zoom all the way to `ZOOM_MAX`.
  - At maximum zoom, confirm Standard panels are visually ~1.5× the minimap
    width and height.
- Compact vs Standard sizing:
  - With Panel-only enabled and density set to Compact:
    - A panel’s visible width should visually match the minimap width.
    - Height should visually match the minimap height.
  - Switch density to Standard:
    - At maximum zoom, panel width should appear about 1.5× the Compact
      width and match the “1.5× minimap” target.
    - Panel height should appear about 1.5× the Compact height and match
      the “1.5× minimap” target.
- Content padding:
  - Image/video content should not touch the panel border.
  - There should be a small uniform margin between the media frame and
    the outer panel edges.
