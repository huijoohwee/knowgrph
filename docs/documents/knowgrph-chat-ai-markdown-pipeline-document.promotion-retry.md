# Promotion Retry Contract

## Scope
This companion documents artifact promotion recovery after `chatKnowgrph` has already persisted the canonical local workspace artifacts.

## Trigger
Promotion retry is relevant only when both conditions are true:

1. the canonical local artifact already exists in Workspace FS
2. GitHub mirroring or Knowgrph storage mirroring failed during finalize

Retry does not regenerate the answer, rerun validation, or replace the saved local artifact. It only retries mirroring for the already-saved paths.

## Exact Operator Command
The canonical retry command is:

```text
#promotion.retry <path...>
```

The command must include one or more normalized saved workspace paths. Typical finalize output includes both the canonical KGC document and its trace companion, for example:

```text
#promotion.retry /workspace/chat/20260522T195000Z/kgc_20260522T195000Z.md /workspace/chat/20260522T195000Z/kgc-trace_20260522T195000Z.md
```

## Surfaces
When promotion fails after a local save, the same runnable command must be exposed across all operator-facing recovery surfaces:

- final assistant ledger text
- browser-local finalize inspection snapshot
- warning toast copy
- toast action that inserts the exact retry command into the composer

The browser-local finalize snapshot carries three recovery fields:

- `failureNote`
- `retryHint`
- `retryCommand`

## Recovery Semantics
- GitHub mirroring remains first in the promotion order.
- If GitHub mirroring fails before storage mirroring, storage is skipped for that finalize attempt.
- Retry promotion reuses the saved local workspace artifact text; it must not synthesize a new artifact body.
- A successful retry clears recovery copy and reports the mirrored promotion result instead of returning another retry command.

## Composer Boundary
- Retry insertion must reuse the shared append-focus chat path rather than a direct composer state write.
- Path-bearing retry commands must preserve their raw path arguments exactly.
- Pure invocation-token spacing may be normalized by the shared seed owner, but retry commands with concrete paths are treated as runnable literals.

## Guardrails
- Do not introduce a second promotion-control channel outside the shared chat invocation contract.
- Do not mutate Canvas graph state as part of retry; graph apply belongs to canonical local persistence, not mirror retry.
- Do not hide the exact command behind toast-only UI. The runnable command must stay visible in text surfaces too.
