# Knowgrph Markdown Agent Discovery

Airvio exposes a progressive-disclosure path that costs no model tokens before document retrieval:

1. `/llms.txt` routes agents to products and machine interfaces.
2. `/knowgrph/llms.txt` describes the Knowgrph application surface.
3. `/api/storage/llms.txt` lists non-empty published Markdown documents.
4. `/api/storage/content-manifest.json` maps every source path to canonical HTML and Markdown URLs.
5. Individual `/api/storage/doc*` routes return `text/markdown`.

The shared agent-ready Pages owner generates the domain index, sitemap, headers, OpenAPI, agent card, and MCP card. The D1 crawler query excludes zero-length editor placeholders without deleting or rewriting their storage rows.

The manifest contains metadata and links, never duplicated document bodies. Editor Workspace Markdown remains the content SSOT; HTML pages and agent-readable Markdown URLs are projections of the same D1-backed document revision and content hash.

Legacy `/knowgrph/openapi.json` and `/knowgrph/api-catalog.json` requests use permanent redirects to their canonical well-known resources. They must never return the SPA HTML fallback with HTTP 200.

## Validation

```bash
npm --prefix canvas run test:ci:unit -- agentReady.httpMcpParity.commerceDiscovery
npm --prefix canvas run test:ci:unit -- storage.worker.defaultLlmsSourceFilesEntrypoint
npm run pages:check-sync
```
