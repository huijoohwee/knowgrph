# Knowgrph XR Mode PRD & TAD

## Overview

Knowgrph XR Mode is a renderer and asset-pipeline extension that lets users inspect graph scenes and model assets spatially without leaving the existing Canvas, Source Files, Markdown Workspace, and Cloudflare delivery chain.

The min-viable-max-value scope is not a new immersive product shell. It is a first-class `xr` 3D mode that reuses the current Three.js / React Three Fiber renderer, GLB/GLTF workspace manifests, rich-media overlay ownership, and Source Files import path. Asset conversion defaults to deterministic FOSS tooling: `png -> svg` through VTracer or Potrace, then `svg -> glb` through the Dev headless GLB compiler, with optional Three.js/Blender exporters and glTF Transform optimization reserved for higher-fidelity follow-up profiles.

**Governing decision**: XR Mode must be useful before a headset session starts. A user should be able to import a `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.svg`, or `.png`, open the XR spatial inspection stage in the browser canvas, and only then enter WebXR when supported by the device and user consent.

**Current implementation baseline**:

- `kgCanvasSurfaceMode: "xr"` is already recognized as a Canvas surface preset.
- Local and URL `.glb` / `.gltf` imports already produce model asset Markdown manifests with `kgCanvasSurfaceMode: "xr"`.
- Three.js canvas rendering already parses model asset documents and renders GLB/GLTF assets without requiring an active WebXR session.
- XR Mode graph scenes already mount a distinct spatial stage instead of plain 3D globe effects.
- A FOSS PNG-to-SVG conversion harness exists in Dev with VTracer/Potrace command adapters, input/path-budget fallback gates, and zero-token cost logging.
- A deterministic SVG-to-GLB compiler exists in Dev with safe-SVG rejection, source provenance, XR manifest metadata, and GLB inspect metrics.

**External reference baseline**:

- WebXR Device API is the browser standard for VR/AR device access, using `navigator.xr.isSessionSupported()` and `navigator.xr.requestSession()` behind user activation and permission boundaries.
- Three.js supports WebXR rendering by enabling `renderer.xr.enabled`, setting an animation loop, and attaching XR session UI / controller inputs.
- glTF/GLB is the preferred runtime model format for Three.js delivery; glTF Transform supports `inspect`, `optimize`, Meshopt/Draco geometry compression, and WebP/KTX2 texture compression.
- VTracer is MIT-licensed FOSS for colored raster-to-vector conversion; Potrace is a mature FOSS bitmap tracer best suited to black/white or thresholded inputs.

# Part A - Product Requirements Document

## Phase 0 - Problem Discovery

### Problem Statement

Solo developers using Knowgrph can already generate, import, and render knowledge graphs, rich media, and 3D model assets, but spatial inspection remains fragmented. Graph topology, GLB/GLTF models, SVG diagrams, and raster references live in separate visual affordances, forcing repeated context switching and making it hard to evaluate whether an asset is suitable for immersive explanation, demo capture, or future AR/VR use.

The opportunity is to add a low-TCO XR inspection path that reuses existing Canvas state and FOSS conversion tools instead of buying a proprietary 3D authoring pipeline or building a new renderer.

### Problem Hypothesis

If Knowgrph exposes XR Mode as a first-class Canvas surface and adds a deterministic FOSS PNG-to-SVG-to-GLB conversion harness, then a solo developer can turn existing visual source material into spatially inspectable artifacts with near-zero monthly TCO, zero default token spend, and measurable asset performance gates.

### Personas

**Solo Dev / Founder** - builds investor demos, product walkthroughs, and AI-native knowledge graph prototypes; needs the smallest implementation that creates differentiated spatial value without paid tooling or ops burden.

**AI Orchestrator** - manages model/harness outputs and asset generation pipelines; needs typed validation, cost logs, and bounded orchestration so asset workflows do not become unmeasured token or GPU spend.

**Technical Reviewer** - verifies PRD/TAD compliance and implementation readiness; needs acceptance criteria that map to existing tests, source owners, and `/goal` conditions.

### Journey: Solo Dev - Convert A Visual Asset Into An XR Inspectable Scene

| Stage | Action | Touchpoint | Pain Point | Opportunity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Has a PNG logo, diagram, screenshot, or GLB model to use in a spatial demo | Source Files / Import URL | Asset type decides behavior unpredictably | Normalize assets into explicit workspace manifests |
| Discover | Imports the asset into Knowgrph | Markdown Workspace / Source Files | Raster assets are not spatially meaningful by default | Offer deterministic FOSS vectorization for suitable PNGs |
| Engage | Opens Canvas XR Mode | Canvas View / Render Settings | WebXR support varies by browser/device | Render an inline XR inspection stage before session entry |
| Complete | Inspects graph/model in browser and optionally enters XR | Three.js canvas / WebXR entry panel | Headset support cannot be assumed | Use progressive enhancement with graceful fallback |
| Return | Exports or reuses optimized model artifacts | Workspace export / Source Files | Performance problems are discovered late | Gate assets through inspect/optimize metrics |

## Product Scope

### In Scope

- First-class `xr` surface mode in Canvas View and frontmatter.
- GLB/GLTF model asset manifests that open directly in XR Mode.
- Distinct graph XR spatial stage using the current display graph, not a separate derivation pipeline.
- Deterministic FOSS `png -> svg` vectorization harness with VTracer default and Potrace fallback.
- Deterministic `svg -> glb` compile path for vector assets that warrant 3D placement.
- GLB inspection gates for generated assets, with optional glTF Transform optimization/reporting profiles.
- TCO, token, and performance metrics emitted per conversion or optional AI-assisted step.
- Declarative Blender-inspired 3D pipeline specification and rendering.

### Out Of Scope

- Proprietary image tracing, proprietary 3D SaaS conversion, or paid model hosting.
- Mandatory headset support before browser canvas preview works.
- Runtime conversion on every render frame.
- A separate XR graph derivation pipeline.
- Multi-user XR collaboration.
- Photorealistic 3D reconstruction from arbitrary PNGs.
- Deployment to Prod or Cloudflare as part of this document generation task.

## Epic KXR-E1 - XR Surface Mode

### User Story

**KXR-E1-S1**: As a Solo Dev, I want `xr` to be a first-class Canvas surface mode, so that I can switch from 2D/3D graph inspection to an XR-ready spatial stage without mutating GraphData.

### Acceptance Criteria

**KXR-E1-S1-AC1** - XR surface selection
* **Given** a workspace document or toolbar action requests `kgCanvasSurfaceMode: "xr"`, **when** Canvas applies the view selection, **then** `canvasRenderMode` becomes `3d` and `canvas3dMode` becomes `xr` before the render surface is activated.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify canvas mode updates by running tests in src/__tests__/canvas3dMode.test.ts and ensuring no non-XR options are dropped`

**KXR-E1-S1-AC2** - Render Settings preserves XR
* **Given** the Render Settings 3D mode select is open, **when** the user selects `xr`, **then** the setting preserves `xr` instead of coercing it to plain `3d`.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify render settings preserve value "xr" by running tests in src/__tests__/canvas3dMode.test.ts`

**KXR-E1-S1-AC3** - Distinct graph spatial stage
* **Given** XR Mode renders graph data, **when** the Three.js scene mounts, **then** it mounts the XR spatial stage and excludes plain 3D globe effects.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify XrGraphStage component is rendered and GlobeEffects are unmounted in ThreeGraph.impl.tsx`

### Workflow: XR Surface Activation

**Trigger**: User selects `xr` from Canvas View Mode toolbar or opens a document with `kgCanvasSurfaceMode: "xr"` frontmatter.
**Actors**: Solo Dev, Canvas View Controller, Zustand Graph Store, Three.js Renderer.

**Happy Path**:
1. Solo Dev selects `xr` from the Canvas toolbar or imports a document with XR frontmatter → Canvas View Controller receives the mode change intent.
2. Canvas View Controller normalizes the mode to `canvasRenderMode: "3d"` and `canvas3dMode: "xr"` → Zustand Graph Store updates state.
3. Three.js Renderer reactively mounts the XR spatial stage and excludes plain 3D globe effects → Solo Dev sees the XR inspection surface.

**Alternate Paths**:
- Already in XR mode: Canvas View Controller detects the mode is unchanged → no store mutation, no re-mount; workflow complete without render churn.

**Error Paths**:
- WebGL context lost: Three.js Renderer emits a context-lost event → Canvas displays a non-blocking recovery message and attempts context restoration on next user interaction.

**Postconditions**: `canvas3dMode === "xr"` in Zustand state; Three.js canvas renders XR spatial stage; no GraphData mutation occurred.

---

## Epic KXR-E2 - Model Asset Ingest And Render

### User Story

**KXR-E2-S1**: As a Solo Dev, I want imported `.glb` and `.gltf` files to open as XR-ready workspace documents, so that model inspection uses Source Files and Markdown Workspace rather than a separate asset manager.

### Acceptance Criteria

**KXR-E2-S1-AC1** - GLB manifest render gate
* **Given** a valid `.glb` model asset document, **when** XR Mode renders it, **then** the Three.js canvas remains mounted even if the document has no graph nodes and the shared model component renders the asset.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify GLB component mounts and parses container validation flags under test:ci:unit`

**KXR-E2-S1-AC2** - GLTF manifest render gate
* **Given** a valid `.gltf` model asset document with source-relative external resources, **when** XR Mode renders it, **then** the GLTF payload preserves the source base path and the loader receives parseable JSON text.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify source-relative base path resolution in GlbAssetModel.tsx passes validation`

**KXR-E2-S1-AC3** - Session-independent inspection
* **Given** the browser does not support immersive WebXR sessions, **when** the user opens an XR model document, **then** the inline canvas still renders the spatial inspection stage and shows a non-blocking XR entry state.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify inline canvas displays model content with data-kg-canvas-xr-status set to "checking" or "unsupported"`

### Workflow: Model Asset Import To XR Render

**Trigger**: Solo Dev imports a `.glb` or `.gltf` file via Source Files, URL import, or drag-and-drop.
**Actors**: Solo Dev, Import Handler, Manifest Builder, Markdown Workspace, XR Renderer.

**Happy Path**:
1. Solo Dev triggers import → Import Handler validates file type and byte length.
2. Import Handler passes raw payload to Manifest Builder → Manifest Builder generates a Markdown model manifest with `kgAssetType: "model"`, `kgCanvasSurfaceMode: "xr"`, and validation metadata.
3. Manifest Builder registers the document in Markdown Workspace → Solo Dev sees the new model document.
4. Solo Dev opens the document → XR Renderer mounts the model in an inline XR spatial stage.

**Alternate Paths**:
- GLTF with external resources: Manifest Builder preserves the `kgAssetUrl` base path so external textures/buffers resolve correctly at load time.
- Browser lacks WebXR: Renderer displays the inline canvas preview with `data-kg-canvas-xr-status="unsupported"` and disables the session entry button.

**Error Paths**:
- Invalid GLB magic number: Manifest Builder records `kgAssetValidGlbMagic: false` → Payload Helper rejects before loader input → Renderer shows structured error state.
- Invalid GLTF JSON: Manifest Builder records `kgAssetValidGltfJson: false` → Payload Helper emits parse error → Renderer shows structured error state.

**Postconditions**: A valid model manifest exists in Markdown Workspace; XR Renderer displays the asset in an inline spatial stage without requiring a WebXR session; invalid assets are rejected with recorded validation flags.

## Epic KXR-E3 - FOSS PNG To SVG To GLB Pipeline

### User Story

**KXR-E3-S1**: As a Solo Dev, I want a FOSS PNG-to-SVG conversion option before GLB compilation, so that logos, diagrams, icons, and UI snapshots can become lightweight vector geometry without paid design tools.

### Acceptance Criteria

**KXR-E3-S1-AC1** - FOSS vectorization harness
* **Given** a PNG input marked for XR conversion, **when** the conversion harness runs, **then** it validates file type and byte limit, chooses VTracer for color inputs or Potrace for black/white thresholded inputs, emits an SVG artifact, and records a zero-token cost log.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify conversion harness returns correct paths and cost log contains zero token values`

**KXR-E3-S1-AC2** - SVG compile to GLB
* **Given** an SVG artifact from the harness, **when** the compile step runs, **then** it produces a GLB workspace model manifest with source provenance, deterministic dimensions, draw-call metadata, and GLB container inspection metadata.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify GLB manifest is created with kgAssetFormat="glb", draw-calls, and triangle counts`

**KXR-E3-S1-AC3** - Raster fallback policy
* **Given** a PNG is photographic, noisy, too large, or unsuitable for vector tracing, **when** the conversion harness evaluates it, **then** it stores the PNG as a texture-on-plane GLB candidate or keeps it as rich media instead of pretending the raster image became real geometry.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify output manifest specifies fallback_reason and sets geometry type to plane_texture`

### Workflow: FOSS PNG To SVG To GLB Conversion

**Trigger**: Solo Dev selects a PNG asset for XR conversion via workspace action or pipeline automation.
**Actors**: Solo Dev, Conversion Harness, VTracer/Potrace CLI, SVG Compiler, GLB Inspector, Manifest Builder.

**Happy Path**:
1. Conversion Harness validates the PNG input schema (file type, byte limit, image dimensions) → input accepted.
2. Harness selects VTracer (color) or Potrace (black/white) → CLI produces SVG artifact.
3. SVG Compiler sanitizes SVG, builds mesh geometry, exports GLB → GLB artifact created.
4. GLB Inspector measures byte length, draw calls, triangle count → inspect report generated.
5. Manifest Builder creates Markdown model manifest with provenance, inspection metadata, and `kgCanvasSurfaceMode: "xr"` → Solo Dev sees XR-ready model.

**Alternate Paths**:
- Path-count budget exceeded: Harness reduces VTracer precision settings and retries once → if still over budget, falls through to fallback path.
- Potrace selected for thresholded color input: Harness preprocesses with ImageMagick threshold before passing to Potrace.

**Error Paths**:
- PNG is photographic/noisy: Harness classifies input as unsuitable → stores original as texture-on-plane GLB candidate with explicit `fallback_reason` → no false vectorization.
- SVG contains unsafe content (scripts, external references): SVG Compiler rejects → structured error with `rejection_reason: "unsafe_svg"`.
- Generated GLB exceeds byte/draw-call budget: Inspector flags over-budget → manifest records budget violation for user review.

**Postconditions**: Either a valid GLB model manifest exists with source provenance and inspect metrics, or the original PNG is preserved with an explicit fallback reason; cost log records zero token spend; no proprietary tool invoked.

## Epic KXR-E4 - Cost, Token, And Performance Observability

### User Story

**KXR-E4-S1**: As an AI Orchestrator, I want every XR conversion and optional AI-assisted step to emit cost, token, and performance logs, so that XR Mode remains ROI-positive and does not hide token or GPU spend.

### Acceptance Criteria

**KXR-E4-S1-AC1** - Deterministic default has zero token spend
* **Given** the default PNG/SVG/GLB pipeline uses only local FOSS tools, **when** it completes, **then** token cost is logged as zero and monthly API cost remains zero.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify cost_log.estimated_cost_usd is exactly 0 and no model calls are made`

**KXR-E4-S1-AC2** - Optional AI steps are harnessed
* **Given** a future AI-assisted asset step is enabled, **when** it calls a model, **then** input/output schemas are validated, token usage is logged, max iteration is one by default, and the circuit breaker rejects calls over budget.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify schema validator blocks over-budget requests and loops terminate at maxIteration = 1`

**KXR-E4-S1-AC3** - Frame budget and asset budget gates
* **Given** an XR scene is loaded on desktop or mobile, **when** the renderer runs the inline canvas preview, **then** p95 frame work remains within budget and generated GLB assets stay under configured byte/draw-call thresholds.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify preview remains stable under 16ms per frame and generated GLB file size is logged`

### Workflow: Cost And Token Observability

**Trigger**: Any XR conversion step or optional AI-assisted step completes execution.
**Actors**: Conversion Harness, AI Harness (future), Cost Logger, Budget Gate.

**Happy Path**:
1. Conversion step completes → Cost Logger emits `{ model: "none", prompt_tokens: 0, completion_tokens: 0, cache_hits: 0, estimated_cost_usd: 0 }`.
2. Budget Gate validates output against configured byte/draw-call/frame thresholds → all within budget.
3. Metrics are persisted to cost log → aggregatable for sprint review.

**Alternate Paths**:
- AI-assisted step enabled (future): AI Harness validates input schema → calls model → validates output schema → logs actual token usage and cost → Budget Gate evaluates against token budget ceiling.

**Error Paths**:
- AI call exceeds token budget: Circuit breaker rejects the call before completion → cost log records the rejected attempt with `rejection_reason: "over_budget"`.
- Generated GLB exceeds asset budget: Budget Gate flags the violation → manifest is annotated with budget overrun for user review.

**Postconditions**: Every conversion step has a cost log entry; zero-token deterministic paths record explicit zeros; budget violations are surfaced, not hidden.

## Epic KXR-E5 - Blender-Inspired 3D Pipeline

### User Story

**KXR-E5-S1**: As a Solo Dev, I want the XR Mode to feature a Blender-inspired 3D pipeline, so that I can configure modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking, and video editing through document-native metadata.

### Acceptance Criteria

**KXR-E5-S1-AC1** - Frontmatter spec rendering
* **Given** a document with `kgAsset3dPipeline` metadata, **when** the canvas mounts in XR mode, **then** the R3F viewport reactively instantiates modeling procedural hulls, armature skinning, timeline animations, and post-rendering effects defined in the spec.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify ThreeGraph mounts the pipeline coordinator and instantiates custom R3F geometry passes without throwing exceptions`

**KXR-E5-S1-AC2** - Procedural modeling & skinned edge rigging
* **Given** modeling and rigging configurations are declared, **when** nodes and edges are rendered, **then** nodes use parametric SDF hulls and curved edges skin their vertex groups dynamically onto multi-joint bone armatures.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify bones hierarchies are initialized and vertex shader skins meshes according to joint weights`

**KXR-E5-S1-AC3** - Animation & simulation solver
* **Given** animation actions and simulation physics are active, **when** the frame updates, **then** node positions update via Verlet integration while the NLA mixer updates keyframe paths.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify Verlet solver updates node position buffers and NLA mixer advances timelines`

**KXR-E5-S1-AC4** - Compositing & video sequencer
* **Given** rendering effects and sequencer tracks are enabled, **when** playing the timeline, **then** the compositor blends background, graph, and UI render passes, while the sequencer executes rendering, text captions, and trace events in sync.
* > **VCC translation**: `Verify EffectComposer passes resolve to final viewport buffer and sequencer emits aligned timestamp events`

### Workflow: Blender-Inspired 3D Pipeline Activation

**Trigger**: User opens a document with `kgAsset3dPipeline` frontmatter metadata in XR Mode.
**Actors**: Solo Dev, Frontmatter Parser, Pipeline Coordinator, Modeling/Rigging/Animation/Simulation/Rendering/Compositing/Tracking/Sequencer modules, R3F Viewport.

**Happy Path**:
1. Frontmatter Parser extracts `kgAsset3dPipeline` object → validated against schema.
2. Pipeline Coordinator receives configuration → instantiates only the declared pipeline stages (e.g., modeling + animation, or rendering + compositing).
3. Active modules register their R3F hooks and shader passes → R3F Viewport renders the configured pipeline.
4. Solo Dev interacts with the spatial scene → pipeline stages respond reactively to state changes.

**Alternate Paths**:
- Partial pipeline: Only some stages are declared (e.g., `modeling` and `rendering` without `simulation`) → Coordinator activates only declared modules; undeclared modules remain dormant with no resource allocation.
- Default fallback: No `kgAsset3dPipeline` in frontmatter → Coordinator applies default PBR material and standard layout without custom pipeline stages.

**Error Paths**:
- Shader compilation failure: Rendering module catches WebGL shader error → falls back to default PBR material → logs the error with shader source reference.
- Simulation divergence: Verlet solver detects position values exceeding safe bounds → circuit-breaker halts simulation → nodes freeze at last valid position → user is notified via console warning.

**Postconditions**: Pipeline modules are instantiated per frontmatter spec; R3F viewport renders the configured stages; undeclared modules consume no resources; shader or simulation failures degrade gracefully without crashing the canvas.

### ROI Calculation

Formula:
$$ROI Score = \frac{User Impact \times Reach}{Build Hours + Monthly TCO + Token Cost / Month}$$

| Feature | Impact | Reach/mo | Build h | TCO/mo | Token/mo | ROI | Priority |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| XR surface mode reuse | 5 | 80 sessions | 6 | 0 | 0 | 66.7 | Must |

| Optional AI 3D reconstruction | 3 | 10 conversions | 24 | 30 | 15 | 0.4 | Won't for MVP |

## MoSCoW Priority

| Tier | Feature | ROI | Rationale |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Must | `xr` Canvas surface preset and Render Settings selection | 66.7 | Highest value per hour; already partially implemented |
| Must | GLB/GLTF workspace manifests render in XR Mode | 37.5 | Converts existing model import into immediate value |
| Must | FOSS PNG->SVG vectorization harness | 20.0 | Meets explicit FOSS and TCO requirement |
| Should | SVG->GLB compile with inspect metadata | 16.0 | Converts vectors into XR-ready model manifests with bounded runtime cost |
| Should | WebXR enter/exit panel with VR then AR support check | 12.0 | Progressive enhancement; inline preview remains primary |
| Should | Blender-inspired 3D pipeline spec & coordinator | 10.4 | Standardizes procedurals, rigging, and post-processing natively |
| Could | KTX2 texture compression for heavy models | 7.0 | Valuable when texture-heavy assets appear |
| Could | Optional AI caption/layout suggestions | 1.5 | Only if user value is proven and token budget is capped |
| Won't | Proprietary tracing or 3D SaaS conversion | 0.5 | Violates FOSS/TCO-zero unless future ROI is extraordinary |
| Won't | Photoreal 3D reconstruction from arbitrary PNG | 0.4 | Too high TCO and low determinism for MVP |

## Min-Viable Scope

MVP is complete when:
- `kgCanvasSurfaceMode: "xr"` activates `canvasRenderMode="3d"` and `canvas3dMode="xr"`.
- Imported GLB/GLTF documents render in inline XR mode without requiring a WebXR session.
- PNG conversion has a deterministic FOSS harness path to SVG with zero token spend.
- Generated or imported model assets carry inspectable metadata and a clear fallback reason when conversion is unsuitable.
- Existing renderer derivation remains the SSOT; XR Mode never forks GraphData.
- The declarative `kgAsset3dPipeline` coordinator reactively configures custom shader, skeleton, and physics solver passes.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | TCO | FOSS / Vendor | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Three.js | Runtime library | $0 | FOSS | Existing dependency; WebXR and GLTFLoader path |
| React Three Fiber | Runtime library | $0 | FOSS | Existing dependency; preserve Canvas ownership |
| glTF Transform CLI | Optional build/conversion CLI | $0 | FOSS | Optional inspect/optimize profile for generated GLB artifacts |

## Open Questions

| Question | Owner | Decision Needed By |
|---|---|---|
| Which higher-fidelity SVG geometry profile should follow the deterministic plane compiler: Three.js extrusion, Blender bevel/extrusion, or both? | Solo Dev | Before visual-fidelity expansion |
| Should the 8 MB PNG input default be adjusted for mobile-first or bulk-import profiles? | Technical Reviewer | Before export integration |
| Should generated GLB assets be committed, stored in workspace storage, or treated as ephemeral build artifacts? | Solo Dev | Before export integration |
| Which WebXR device/browser pair is the canonical smoke-test target? | Solo Dev | Before live XR validation |
| For larger graphs (600+ nodes), should the simulation solver run on a Web Worker or WASM thread to prevent main thread frame drops? | Technical Reviewer | Before simulation implementation |

# Part B - Technical Architecture Document

## Architecture Overview

**From source asset or graph to XR preview**: Source Files / Markdown Workspace -> frontmatter preset and model manifest parser -> shared graph/model payload -> Three.js scene -> inline XR spatial stage -> optional WebXR session.

XR Mode is a renderer variant over the existing display graph and model asset contracts. It does not own GraphData derivation, persistence, or deployment. It adds session entry, spatial staging, and asset-pipeline proof metadata around existing owners.

## Deployment Strategy

This document is a source document only. Implementation should land in `knowgrph` Dev first, then follow the existing Dev -> Prod -> Cloudflare chain only when explicitly requested.

Release sequence:
1. Validate existing XR mode tests.
2. Add deterministic FOSS PNG->SVG harness behind explicit user action.
3. Add SVG->GLB compile and GLB inspect report; add glTF Transform optimize/reporting only when the artifact profile needs it.
4. Add the declarative `kgAsset3dPipeline` parser and R3F coordinator.
5. Add focused browser smoke for inline XR graph/model preview.
6. Publish only after user approval and standard sync checks.

Rollback:
- Disable conversion menu action while preserving existing GLB/GLTF import manifests.
- Keep `xr` frontmatter normalization but fall back to plain 3D rendering if XR stage fails.
- Do not delete source PNG/SVG artifacts on failed conversion.

# Architectural Decisions

## ADR-001: Reuse Existing Three.js WebXR Surface
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-06-02

### Context
Knowgrph already ships Three.js and React Three Fiber, has lazy 3D chunk budgets, and has tests for XR mode normalization and model rendering. Adding a separate XR framework would increase bundle size, ownership complexity, and TCO.

### Decision
Reuse the existing Three.js / React Three Fiber surface and enable WebXR as progressive enhancement through `renderer.xr.enabled` and a session entry panel.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Existing Three.js surface**: Lowest implementation cost; preserves current graph/model contracts; FOSS.
2. **A-Frame or Babylon.js**: FOSS and capable, but adds a parallel scene/rendering stack.
3. **Native OpenXR app**: Strong device support, but outside web deployment chain and high TCO.

### Rationale
The existing surface already renders graph and model data. XR Mode's highest ROI is to add spatial staging and session entry, not replatform rendering.

### TCO Impact

| Dimension | Chosen Option | Best FOSS Alternative | Delta / 12 months |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infra cost | $0/mo (existing Three.js) | $0/mo (A-Frame) | $0 |
| Egress cost | Existing site delivery | Existing site delivery | $0 |
| Token cost | $0/mo | $0/mo | $0 |
| Vendor risk | Low (FOSS) | Low (FOSS) | — |

---

## ADR-002: GLB/GLTF Markdown Manifests Are The Workspace Contract
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-06-02

### Context
Knowgrph Source Files and Markdown Workspace already use Markdown/frontmatter as the activation contract. Raw binary assets need validation, provenance, and renderer presets.

### Decision
Represent imported GLB/GLTF assets as Markdown model manifests containing validation metadata, embedded payload or source URL, and XR frontmatter presets.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Markdown model manifest**: Reuses existing workspace, parser, Source Files, and renderer contracts.
2. **Raw asset table**: Cleaner binary storage, but creates a second workspace authority.
3. **External asset manager service**: Powerful, but high TCO and vendor/ops burden.

### Rationale
Manifests keep model assets queryable, inspectable, and compatible with existing Markdown/frontmatter workflows.

### TCO Impact

| Dimension | Chosen Option | Best FOSS Alternative | Delta / 12 months |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infra cost | $0/mo (Markdown manifests) | $0/mo (raw asset table) | $0 |
| Egress cost | Existing asset delivery | Existing asset delivery | $0 |
| Token cost | $0/mo | $0/mo | $0 |
| Vendor risk | Low (internal) | Low (internal) | — |

---

## ADR-003: FOSS PNG To SVG Uses VTracer Default And Potrace Fallback
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-06-02

### Context
The user explicitly requires FOSS `png -> svg`. PNG is raster; SVG is vector. Real conversion requires tracing, and the right tool differs by input type.

### Decision
Use VTracer as the default for color PNGs and Potrace as the fallback for black/white or thresholded line art. Reject proprietary tracing in MVP.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **VTracer default**: FOSS MIT; handles color images and produces compact SVG paths.
2. **Potrace fallback**: FOSS; excellent for black/white bitmap tracing; requires preprocessing for color/greyscale inputs.
3. **Adobe Illustrator Image Trace or online converters**: Can be convenient but violates TCO-zero and vendor-control goals.
4. **Embed PNG inside SVG**: Not acceptable as vectorization; wraps raster data.

### Rationale
VTracer covers the most useful solo-dev asset set: colored logos, diagrams, low-noise illustrations, and pixel art. Potrace remains valuable for monochrome or thresholded technical drawings.

### TCO Impact

| Dimension | Chosen Option | Best FOSS Alternative | Delta / 12 months |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infra cost | $0/mo (VTracer local CLI) | $0/mo (Potrace local CLI) | $0 |
| Egress cost | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Token cost | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Build/ops cost | Medium (two adapters) | Low (single adapter) | ~2h additional build |
| Vendor risk | Low (FOSS MIT) | Low (FOSS GPL) | — |

---

## ADR-004: Default XR Asset Pipeline Is Deterministic And Zero-Token
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-06-02

### Context
AI-native products can accidentally hide recurring token/API cost in asset workflows. XR Mode should support optional AI later, but MVP value does not require model calls.

### Decision
Default XR asset conversion uses deterministic local/FOSS tooling only. Optional AI steps are out of MVP and must use a schema-validated harness with explicit token budgets.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Deterministic FOSS conversion**: Zero token spend; predictable; lower TCO.
2. **AI-assisted SVG/3D generation**: Potentially higher visual quality; higher cost and variance.
3. **Hosted 3D generation API**: Fast demos; high vendor and token/API TCO risk.

### Rationale
The MVP goal is to make existing assets spatially inspectable. That can be achieved with zero-token deterministic tooling, preserving AI budget for higher-value orchestration.

### TCO Impact

| Dimension | Chosen Option | Best FOSS Alternative | Delta / 12 months |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infra cost | $0/mo (local FOSS) | $0/mo (same) | $0 |
| Egress cost | $0 (local conversion) | $0 | $0 |
| Token cost | $0/mo | $0/mo | $0 |
| GPU/API cost | $0/mo | $0/mo | $0 |
| Vendor risk | Low | Low | — |

## ADR-005: Frontmatter-Driven Blender-Inspired 3D Pipeline
**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-06-17

### Context
Implementing a complex, multi-stage 3D pipeline natively in the rendering code can easily lead to hardcoded components and rigid rendering behaviors that drift from document-native representation.

### Decision
Expose the configuration of the 8-stage 3D pipeline reactively through a new `kgAsset3dPipeline` frontmatter spec. The Three.js/R3F viewport dynamically adapts modeling, armature rigging, physics simulations, and compositing blend nodes based on this document specification.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Document-native spec coordinator**: Retains universality and neutrality, mapping spec parameters to dynamic runtime components.
2. **Hardcoded client engine**: Fast to compile initially but results in a brittle codebase and violates "spec-complete -> runtime-ready" design patterns.
3. **External runtime scripts**: Embed custom JavaScript in the document body, but creates significant security and sandbox-escaping risks.

### Rationale
By moving the 3D pipeline settings into the Markdown document's frontmatter, we keep the codebase decoupled and generic, satisfying the TCO-zero, token economics, and agnosticism lenses.

### TCO Impact

| Dimension | Chosen Option | Best FOSS Alternative | Delta / 12 months |
|---|---|---|---|
| Infra cost | $0/mo (client-side only) | $0/mo (same) | $0 |
| Egress cost | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Token cost | $0/mo (no model calls) | $0/mo | $0 |
| Build/ops cost | Low | Medium (hardcoded engine maintenance) | -4h/mo maintenance |
| Vendor risk | Low (FOSS) | Low (FOSS) | — |

# Validation Checklist

**Pre-Implementation (PRD)**:
- [ ] Valid YAML frontmatter present with `frontmatter_contract: "required"`
- [ ] Personas and user journey documented; every story anchored to a journey stage
- [ ] Workflows defined with trigger, happy path, alternate paths, error paths, and postconditions per epic
- [ ] Data flows typed at every stage boundary with persistence and error handling documented
- [ ] User stories follow "As a… I want… So that" format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria use Given-When-Then with observable outcomes
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion translatable to a VCC: one measurable end state + a stated check + scope constraints
- [ ] Features prioritized via MoSCoW with ROI score and rationale per feature
- [ ] Min-viable scope explicitly stated for Must-tier features before implementation begins
- [ ] Token budget estimated for every AI-powered pipeline: 0 for MVP deterministic paths
- [ ] Monthly TCO estimated for every dependency; FOSS-first decision recorded in ADR
- [ ] ROI score computed for every Must/Should feature using `(impact × reach) / (build + TCO + token cost)`

**Pre-Implementation (TAD)**:
- [ ] Components have single responsibility; interfaces specified with explicit contracts
- [ ] AI components have harness contract: typed input schema, typed output schema, cost log fields, fallback path
- [ ] Orchestration topology specified for every pipeline: sequential with max-iteration bound and circuit-breaker condition
- [ ] Architectural decisions documented with ADRs including TCO comparison table and FOSS alternative
- [ ] Architecture diagrams use Mermaid (not ASCII for >5 nodes)
- [ ] Component inventory table accompanies every architecture diagram
- [ ] PRD-to-TAD traceability established via `PRD-[Epic]-[Story] ↔ TAD-[Component]-[Interface]`
- [ ] VCCs recorded in TAD component specs and traced to source criteria
- [ ] No implementation detail in PRD; no business logic in TAD

**Post-Documentation Review**:
- [ ] Stakeholders validate PRD addresses user problems
- [ ] Development confirms TAD provides sufficient guidance
- [ ] QA confirms acceptance criteria are objectively testable
- [ ] Success metrics defined with baseline, target, and timeline
- [ ] Quality attributes specified with measurable scenarios; token cost and TCO attributes present
- [ ] Open questions resolved or formally tracked
- [ ] Token budget actuals vs estimates reviewed each sprint; projections updated on model pricing or traffic changes
- [ ] FOSS alternatives re-evaluated if any dependency TCO crosses the 12-month justification threshold

# Role—Action—Outcome

**Solo Dev / Founder** → validates problem, maps user journey, writes stories and acceptance criteria, applies MoSCoW with ROI scoring, defines min-viable scope, selects FOSS tools → produces user-centric PRD and drives high-ROI feature delivery at near-zero TCO.

**AI Orchestrator** → designs harness contracts for conversion pipelines, sets token budgets, validates cost logs, specifies orchestration topology with circuit breakers → ensures XR asset pipelines are observable, bounded, and ROI-positive.

**Technical Reviewer** → reviews TAD for feasibility, validates architectural patterns, confirms ADR TCO comparisons, verifies VCC traceability → ensures XR implementation is technically sound and guideline-compliant.

# Mantra Application

**"CID frames PRD/TAD standards · Flow patterns anchor stories to reality · RAO aligns team responsibilities · SVO clarifies requirement semantics · VCC closes the loop from criterion to verified implementation"**

- **CID frames**: establishes XR Mode scope (spatial inspection + asset conversion), purpose (user value through inline XR preview), rules (FOSS-first, zero-token default, frontmatter-driven pipeline)
- **Flow patterns anchor**: user journey (Solo Dev asset-to-XR), workflows (per-epic trigger→happy→alternate→error→postcondition), and data flows (surface activation, model ingest, PNG→SVG→GLB, pipeline activation) connect abstract XR requirements to observable system behavior
- **RAO aligns**: maps Solo Dev/Founder, AI Orchestrator, and Technical Reviewer to their respective documentation deliverables with clear accountability
- **SVO clarifies**: users import assets → harnesses convert deterministically → renderers display spatially → sessions enhance progressively — enabling unambiguous XR implementation
- **VCC closes**: every acceptance criterion (KXR-E*-S*-AC*) maps to a VCC condition in the Traceability table; the chain extends from PRD through TAD to autonomous verification via `/goal` conditions
