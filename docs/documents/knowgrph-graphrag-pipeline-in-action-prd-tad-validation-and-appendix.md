# knowgrph GraphRAG Pipeline In Action PRD/TAD: Validation and Appendix

Continuation of knowgrph-graphrag-pipeline-in-action-prd-tad.md covering quality attributes, deployment, validation, analytics, glossary, and implementation notes.

### Quality Attributes

#### Performance

**Requirement**: System processes 1000-word documents with analytics end-to-end in <4 seconds (p95 latency).

**Architecture Pattern**: Sequential pipeline with early-exit on errors, efficient sparse matrix operations for TF-IDF, incremental graph construction.

**Validation**: Load test with 100 sample documents measuring per-stage latency.

**Metrics**:
```
NLTK preprocessing: <50ms
spaCy NER: <500ms
Triple extraction: <200ms
TF-IDF computation: <100ms
Graph construction: <150ms
PageRank calculation: <300ms
Louvain community detection: <400ms
Causality detection: <100ms
Visualization render: <300ms
Total: <2100ms (with 90% buffer = 3990ms)
```

---

#### Scalability

**Requirement**: Support documents up to 10,000 words and graphs up to 500 nodes without client-side memory issues.

**Architecture Pattern**: Sparse matrix representations for TF-IDF, efficient NetworkX data structures, canvas-based rendering (not DOM).

**Validation**: Stress test with 15,000-word documents and 750-node graphs monitoring browser memory usage (<800MB).

**Constraints**: 
- Beyond 10k words, recommend server-side processing
- Beyond 500 nodes, recommend graph simplification (edge pruning, node aggregation)

---

#### Accuracy

**Requirement**: Analytics metrics match reference implementations within acceptable tolerances.

**Architecture Pattern**: Use established libraries (scikit-learn, NetworkX) as ground truth, validate outputs.

**Validation**: Unit tests comparing outputs to reference implementations.

**Tolerances**:
- TF-IDF scores: ≤5% relative error vs scikit-learn
- PageRank scores: ≤5% relative error vs NetworkX
- Community modularity: ≤10% relative error vs python-louvain
- Causality precision: ≥70% on manually labeled test set

---

#### Usability

**Requirement**: Users with basic NLP knowledge understand analytics metrics without documentation.

**Architecture Pattern**: Inline tooltips, progressive disclosure UI, visual encoding of metrics (node size = importance, edge thickness = strength).

**Validation**: User testing with 10 participants achieving >85% task completion without help.

**Metrics**:
- Time to understand PageRank ranking: <60 seconds
- Ability to identify strongest causal relationship: >90% accuracy
- Understanding of community groupings: >85% correct interpretation

---

#### Maintainability

**Requirement**: Developers can swap analytics algorithms (e.g., TF-IDF → KeyBERT) without rewriting UI.

**Architecture Pattern**: Interface-based component contracts, dependency injection, config-driven algorithm selection.

**Validation**: Successfully swap TF-IDF for KeyBERT implementation in <6 hours.

**Design Principles**:
- Each analytics component implements interface contract
- No direct library imports in UI layer
- Configuration file externalizes algorithm choices

---

#### Observability

**Requirement**: Developers can debug analytics failures by inspecting intermediate outputs and metrics.

**Architecture Pattern**: Stage-level logging with metric snapshots, structured error messages, debug mode with detailed outputs.

**Validation**: Inject errors at each analytics stage and verify clear error messages + recovery guidance.

**Telemetry**:
```typescript
interface AnalyticsStageMetrics {
  stage: string
  status: "success" | "error"
  latency_ms: number
  input_size: number
  output_size: number
  metrics: {
    avg_tfidf?: number
    avg_pagerank?: number
    num_communities?: number
    modularity?: number
  }
  error_message?: string
}
```

---

### Deployment Strategy

**Pattern**: Static artifact deployment (client-side only)

**Deployment Flow**:
1. Build React application → bundle JavaScript/CSS with analytics libraries
2. Verify NLP model loading → test spaCy model import
3. Validate analytics computation → run test suite on sample documents
4. Deploy to CDN → upload to Cloudflare Pages / Netlify
5. Validate in production → smoke test with analytics pipeline

**Rollback Strategy**: Revert to previous CDN version via version tags.

**Zero-Downtime**: Not applicable (client-side app, no backend).

---

### Migration Path

**Current State**: Users have v1.0.0 with basic entity extraction and graph construction.

**Target State**: Users have v2.0.0 with entity importance ranking, causality detection, and community clustering.

**Migration Steps**:
1. **Phase 1** (Week 1-3): Add TF-IDF scoring and basic centrality
2. **Phase 2** (Week 4-5): Add causality detection and edge strength
3. **Phase 3** (Week 6-7): Add Louvain community detection
4. **Phase 4** (Week 8-9): Add interactive analytics dashboard with filtering
5. **Phase 5** (Week 10): Performance optimization and user testing

**Backward Compatibility**: v2.0.0 API-compatible with v1.0.0 - analytics are additive enhancements.

**Data Migration**: Not applicable (session-only storage, no persistent data).

## PART VI: ANALYTICS LAYER SPECIFICATION

### Entity Layer (Nodes)

**Metrics Computed**:
1. **Frequency**: Count of entity mentions in corpus
2. **TF-IDF Score**: Term frequency × inverse document frequency (normalized [0,1])
3. **PageRank**: Importance based on graph structure (normalized [0,1])
4. **HITS (Hubs & Authorities)**: Hub score (points to authorities) and Authority score (pointed to by hubs)
5. **Degree Centrality**: Number of connections (normalized [0,1])
6. **Betweenness Centrality**: Fraction of shortest paths through node (normalized [0,1])
7. **Closeness Centrality**: Inverse sum of shortest paths to all other nodes (normalized [0,1])

#### Response-01

```
I've created an **interactive demo** that shows your minimum viable FOSS GraphRAG pipeline in action. The demo visualizes each step processing the Singapore text through the stack.

**Key features:**
- Click through 5 pipeline stages
- See actual outputs at each step
- Code snippets kept to 2-3 lines max (per your requirement)
- Links to all FOSS repos at bottom
- Shows real entities, triples, and graph structure

**Strictly FOSS components shown:**
1. **NLTK** → Stopword removal, lemmatization
2. **HuggingFace Tokenizers** → Subword tokenization for LLM compatibility
3. **spaCy** → NER (Singapore/GPE, Changi Airport/FAC) + POS tagging
4. **Triple Extraction** → Semantic relationships like "(Singapore, located-in, Southeast Asia)"
5. **NetworkX** → Graph construction with ~7 nodes, 6 edges, 2 communities (demo text)

The demo shows how your text flows through each component and what gets extracted at each stage—from raw text to a structured knowledge graph ready for LLM retrieval.
```

## Implementation (Canvas)

This PRD/TAD is implemented in the `knowgrph/canvas` pipeline as a domain-agnostic, client-side demo that produces canonical `GraphData` plus inspectable intermediate outputs.

### Where It Lives

- Pipeline (sequential stages, metrics, FOSS attribution): `canvas/src/lib/graph/graphragTextPipeline.ts`
- Parser integration (auto-detect `.txt` + plain-text `.md`): `canvas/src/features/parsers/default.ts` (`graphrag-text`)
- UI visualization (stage-by-stage inspector): `canvas/src/features/panels/views/GraphRagTextPipelineSection.tsx` (Parser tab)
- AIE book chapter snippet demo (multi-input, extraction fidelity): `canvas/src/features/demo/GraphRagAieBookChapterSummariesDemo.tsx`, `canvas/src/features/demo/aieBookChapterSnippets.ts`
- Tests (neutral fixtures + demo-fidelity fixtures): `canvas/src/__tests__/graphragTextPipeline.test.ts`, `canvas/src/__tests__/aieBookGraphRagTextPipeline.test.ts`, `canvas/src/__tests__/fixtures/graphrag-text-demo.md`

### Scope Notes

- The Canvas demo remains extraction-only (no LLM API integration) and runs without server dependencies.
- Library references and code snippets are shown for transparency; the demo pipeline itself uses heuristic implementations (bounded summarization + sentence-level evidence spans) to stay portable.
- Context-Aware Analytics (PageRank / HITS / Betweenness / Closeness) can be toggled from BottomPanel (Parser/Stats); the effective settings are captured in `GraphData.metadata.graphragTextPipeline.config`.
