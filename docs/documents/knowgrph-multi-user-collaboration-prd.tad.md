# Knowgrph Multi-User Collaboration - PRD & TAD

**Document Version**: 1.3.1
**Date**: 2026-07-11
**Status**: Accepted and implemented authenticated room transport  
**Scope**: MainPanel Collaboration, authenticated storage-room transport, fallback no-server WebRTC invite/answer flow, peer roster, presence, document sync, targeted follow mode

---

## Document Purpose

**Context**: Knowgrph now ships an authenticated collaboration room for storage-configured workspaces. The canonical path uses storage-backed session auth plus a workspace-scoped canvas-room WebSocket for live document sync, roster state, remote caret presence, and targeted follow mode. The older invite/answer WebRTC path remains only as a fallback when authenticated room transport is not configured.

**Intent**: Preserve a precise source-owned record of the current shipped collaboration path, make PRD and TAD evidence evaluable by tests, and keep the fallback P2P implementation explicitly scoped so it does not overtake the authenticated room baseline.

**Directive**: Collaboration behavior must remain source-owned by the authenticated storage-room runtime, storage room client contract, Worker/Durable Object room owners, shared collaboration store, and MainPanel view. Do not add parallel collaboration panels, downstream patches, hardcoded room fixtures, or compatibility aliases that compete with the authenticated room baseline.

**Current canonical path**: the current canonical collaboration path for storage-configured workspaces is the authenticated canvas-room transport. The fallback no-server WebRTC invite/answer flow remains available only when authenticated room transport is not configured.

## Product Contract

### Problem Statement

Single-user workspace editing blocks pair-review, guided exploration, and handoff moments. A collaborator should be able to join the active document quickly, see who else is present, receive document updates, and optionally follow a selected peer without requiring a server-side room service.

### Personas

| Persona | Job To Be Done | Success Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace owner | Start a collaboration session from the current workspace document | Invite token or URL is generated and shareable |
| Guest collaborator | Join a host session from an invite and return an answer | Host can apply the answer and establish a data channel |
| Reviewer or navigator | Follow one selected remote peer | Viewport reveal is targeted and stops when the peer leaves |

### Journey: Workspace Owner and Guest - Active Document Collaboration

| Stage | Action | Touchpoint | Pain Point | Opportunity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Owner needs another person to inspect the current document | MainPanel Collaboration tab | Collaboration is otherwise external to the canvas | Keep the workflow inside Knowgrph |
| Discover | Owner starts a host session | Collaboration actions | Server rooms would require setup and auth | Generate a no-server WebRTC invite |
| Engage | Guest joins and returns an answer | Invite and answer token fields | Connection setup needs deterministic metadata | Preserve session, owner, peer, and document keys |
| Complete | Peers exchange roster, presence, and document state | WebRTC data channel | Multi-peer state can drift | Owner relays roster and document updates |
| Return | Peer follows a selected collaborator | Follow target control | Untargeted presence can cause noisy jumps | Reveal only the selected live remote peer |

### User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Story | Acceptance Criteria | `/goal` Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRD-COLLAB-01 | As a workspace owner, I want to start a host session and generate an invite token or URL so another peer can join my active document without a server-side room service. | MainPanel exposes `collaboration`; the shared panel-open event accepts the collaboration tab; the view queues `start-host`; runtime creates version, invite id, session id, owner peer id, host peer id, display name, document key, offer, and created time; invite uses shared token helpers and `kgCollab`. | `multiUserCollaboration.docs.implementedP2POwners`, `collaboration.runtime.host.remount.preservesPendingInvite`, and `npm --prefix canvas run validate:multi-user-collaboration:e2e` pass |
| PRD-COLLAB-02 | As a guest, I want to paste an invite and generate an answer token so the host can complete the WebRTC connection. | Store queues `join-invite`; `parseP2PInviteInput()` validates the invite; answer preserves session, owner, invite, guest, and display-name metadata; answer can be carried by `kgCollabAnswer`. | `collaboration.protocol.inviteAnswerRoster.preserveOwnerMetadata` passes |
| PRD-COLLAB-03 | As the host, I want to relay roster, presence, and document updates across connected guests so each peer sees the active collaboration state. | Wire messages include `hello`, `presence`, `document-sync`, and `session-roster`; document sync includes stable document key and text hash; host broadcasts roster updates; remote peers include ownership, connection state, caret line, and last-seen metadata. | `collaboration.runtime.hostRelay.multipeerRosterPresenceAndDocument` passes |
| PRD-COLLAB-04 | As a collaborator, I want follow mode to reveal only the selected live remote peer so collaboration does not cause noisy viewport or caret jumps. | Store scopes `followPeerId` to live remote peers; reveal is gated by `followModeEnabled` and selected peer; disconnect or removal clears stale follow targets. | `collaboration.store.followTarget.scopedToLiveRemotePeers` and `collaboration.runtime.followMode.revealsOnlyTargetedPeer` pass |

### MoSCoW, ROI, and TCO

| Priority | Capability | ROI Score | TCO Estimate | Rationale |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Must | MainPanel P2P invite/answer, roster, presence, document sync, follow target | 12 | 0 USD/month infra; 0 model tokens | Highest value per scope unit because it ships collaboration without server setup |
| Should | Runtime lifecycle guards for disconnect, owner removal, and remount | 9 | 0 USD/month infra; 0 model tokens | Prevents stale sessions and false collaboration state |
| Could | Authenticated membership, server audit, Durable room service | 4 | Non-zero Worker/D1/room operation cost | Deferred until source-owned auth and persistence owners exist |
| Won't for pilot | Parallel collaboration panels, hardcoded room fixtures, legacy alias remapping | 0 | Not accepted | Conflicts with source ownership and neutral architecture |

ROI estimate uses `(User Impact x Reach) / (Build Hours + Monthly TCO + Token Cost / Month)`. The pilot stays inside a zero-token, browser-native path; no AI harness is invoked by this feature.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Collaboration discoverability | Collaboration absent from MainPanel | `MAIN_PANEL_TABS` includes `collaboration` | `multiUserCollaboration.docs.implementedP2POwners` |
| Invite/answer fidelity | Peer metadata can be dropped | Owner/session/peer metadata round-trips | `collaboration.protocol.inviteAnswerRoster.preserveOwnerMetadata` |
| Runtime relay | Single-peer or stale relay risk | Multi-peer roster, presence, and document relay covered | `collaboration.runtime.*` |
| Follow-mode safety | Presence can reveal the wrong peer | Reveal only selected live peer and clear stale target | `collaboration.store.followTarget.scopedToLiveRemotePeers` |
| Cost envelope | Server room cost would be non-zero | 0 USD/month infra and 0 model tokens for pilot | Browser WebRTC and local runtime tests |
| No auth overclaim | Planned auth could be mistaken as shipped | Docs guard rejects shipped-language claims for D1/JWT auth | `multiUserCollaborationDocs.test.ts` |

### Planned Extension: Runtime Media Collaboration

The authenticated room transport is now the shipped collaboration baseline for storage-configured workspaces. Cloudflare-backed media collaboration remains a planned extension for workspaces that need durable image/audio/video sharing across collaborators, refreshes, and devices. The fallback P2P pilot stays in the repo for envless collaboration only when authenticated room transport is unavailable.

| Capability | Storage owner | Collaboration role |
|---|---|---|
| FloatingPanel Media and `@ Upload Media` | Shared Media upload/inventory helpers | Upload or select image/audio/video and insert a typed inline chip into the active card field. |
| R2 | Storage Worker object route | Persist media binary blobs; browser object URLs and provider URLs are never durable state. |
| D1 | `media_artifacts` metadata/provenance | Record content type, object key, source action, workspace/run/card context, and provenance. |
| KV | Media access namespace | Cache short-lived openable URLs only when a real namespace is bound. |
| Durable Objects | Canvas room object | Broadcast latest media asset notification and room sync state to connected collaborators. |

Acceptance for this extension requires R2 object confirmation and D1 metadata confirmation before a media item can be presented as Cloudflare-synced. Durable Objects may fan out media-room notifications, but they must not become the canonical blob or provenance store.

### Component Specifications

| Component | Responsibility | Inputs | Outputs | Failure Handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CollaborationView.tsx` | Render session controls, roster rows, follow controls, and owner actions | Store state and registered MainPanel actions | Queued collaboration commands and visible peer state | Disables invalid actions and surfaces status/error text |
| `p2pCollaborationProtocol.ts` | Encode, decode, and validate invite, answer, and wire messages | URL token or JSON wire message | Typed collaboration payload | Rejects malformed payloads without mutating session state |
| `p2pCollaborationStore.ts` | Own session state, peer roster, follow target, and command queue | UI commands and runtime updates | Zustand collaboration state | Clears stale follow targets and resets invalid session state |
| `useP2PCollaborationRuntime.ts` | Bind WebRTC lifecycle to store/runtime effects | Active document key/text and callbacks | Data channel messages and remote document application | Closes stale connections and emits explicit runtime errors |
| `useP2PCollaborationCommandEffect.ts` | Execute start, join, apply-answer, disconnect, and remove-peer commands | Pending command and runtime refs | Session phase updates and peer connection setup | Fails closed on invalid WebRTC or mismatched answer state |
| `useP2PCollaborationBroadcastEffects.ts` | Broadcast local document, hello, presence, and roster changes | Active document, follow, and local caret state | `document-sync`, `hello`, `presence`, `session-roster` messages | Debounces document sends and avoids echo loops |

### Workflow: Host Invite and Guest Answer

**Trigger**: Owner selects Collaboration and starts a host session.
**Actors**: Owner browser, guest browser, Collaboration view, store, protocol helpers, WebRTC runtime.

**Happy Path**:
1. Owner queues `start-host`; runtime creates a WebRTC offer and encoded invite.
2. Guest pastes invite and queues `join-invite`; runtime creates an answer.
3. Owner applies the answer; both peers open a data channel.
4. Runtime sends hello, presence, document sync, and roster messages.

**Alternate Paths**:
- Owner starts another invite before applying an answer: pending invite is closed and replaced by the new source-owned invite.
- Guest reconnects from a new answer: owner applies only the answer matching the current session and invite id.

**Error Paths**:
- Browser lacks WebRTC: runtime sets an explicit error and leaves the session closed.
- Answer metadata mismatches the current invite: runtime rejects the answer and preserves the current session state.

**Postconditions**: Store contains local and remote peers, connection phase is connected, roster metadata is current, and document/follow updates flow only through the runtime owner.

### Data Flow: Active Document Collaboration

| Stage | Component | Input Format | Output Format | Persistence | Error Handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ingest | `CollaborationView.tsx` | UI action and token text | Store command | Store memory only | Reject empty or invalid command state |
| Transform | `p2pCollaborationProtocol.ts` | Encoded invite/answer or JSON wire message | Typed payload | None | Return parse failure before runtime mutation |
| Transport | WebRTC data channel | Typed wire message serialized as JSON | Peer message event | Browser connection only | Close channel and update peer state on disconnect |
| Store | `p2pCollaborationStore.ts` | Runtime peer/session updates | Roster, phase, follow state | Client runtime state | Clear stale peer/follow data |
| Consume | Active document runtime callbacks | `document-sync` and presence payloads | Remote document apply and line reveal | Active workspace document owner | Suppress echo signatures and skip mismatched documents |

### Integration Contracts

| Contract | Required Fields | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Invite token | protocol version, kind, invite id, session id, owner peer id, host peer id, host display name, document key, offer, created time | `p2pCollaborationProtocol.ts` |
| Answer token | protocol version, kind, invite id, session id, owner peer id, guest peer id, guest display name, answer, created time | `p2pCollaborationProtocol.ts` |
| Wire message | protocol version, kind, session id, peer metadata, sent time, plus message-specific payload | `p2pCollaborationProtocol.ts` |
| Runtime command | monotonic command id, command kind, optional peer id | `p2pCollaborationStore.ts` |

### ADR-001: Authenticated Room Transport As Canonical Path When Configured

#### Context

Knowgrph needs collaborative canvas/document workflows with real user identity, document-scoped rooms, and cheap repeatable regression proof. Once the Worker auth boundary, storage room route, and Durable Object relay existed, keeping P2P invite flow as the default would have created stale architecture and the wrong validation target.

#### Decision

Use authenticated storage-room transport as the canonical collaboration path whenever storage env is configured. Keep the browser-native WebRTC P2P path only as a fallback when those bindings are absent.

#### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | FOSS / Vendor | 12-Month TCO | Decision |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Authenticated storage room service | Cloudflare Worker/Durable Object | Low incremental operational cost | Accepted as canonical path when configured |
| Browser WebRTC data channel | Browser-native open standard | 0 USD infra | Retained as fallback only |
| Proprietary realtime service | Vendor managed service | Non-zero subscription and egress risk | Rejected for pilot |

#### Rationale

The accepted path maximizes value per scope unit by reusing the existing storage auth boundary and Durable Object room service while still preserving a zero-infra fallback for envless local use.

#### Consequences

Storage-configured workspaces now support authenticated room joins, Worker-gated membership/session checks, and Durable Object relay for live document sync. The fallback P2P path remains non-persistent and should not be treated as the default shipped collaboration path.

### Quality Attributes

| Attribute | Scenario | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reliability | Peer disconnects or owner removes a guest | Stale peer and follow target clear deterministically | `collaboration.runtime.ownerRemoval.keepsSessionAliveAndBroadcastsRoster` |
| Security | Malformed invite, answer, or wire message appears | Parser rejects before runtime mutation | Protocol parser tests |
| Performance | Active document changes while peers are connected | Broadcast is debounced and echo-suppressed | Runtime relay tests |
| Observability | Session state changes | UI exposes phase, status, roster, and error text | MainPanel Collaboration UI tests |
| Token cost | Collaboration runtime executes | 0 model calls and 0 tokens | No AI harness in component inventory |
| TCO | Pilot runs locally in browsers | 0 USD/month infra for shipped baseline | ADR-001 |

## Out of Scope for the Implemented Pilot

- Email/password sign-up and sign-in.
- Workspace membership tables and invitation email delivery.
- Permission-gated D1 CRUD routes.
- Additional Durable Object media-room extensions beyond the shipped authenticated document room.
- Multi-document merge/conflict UI.
- Treating richer role, audit, or quota extensions as already complete just because the authenticated room baseline is shipped.

## Planned Extension Boundary

The remaining collaboration extension work now sits above the shipped authenticated room baseline. Media fan-out, richer workspace roles, longer-lived audit history, and quota policy owners still need focused source ownership before this document can mark them as shipped.

| Planned Capability | Required Owner Before Acceptance |
|---|---|
| Richer workspace auth and JWT validation surfaces | storage Worker auth middleware and focused tests |
| Workspace roles | D1 membership schema and role-checking routes |
| Permission-gated push/pull/export | storage Worker route checks |
| Server-backed activity/audit trail | D1 sync-event user attribution |
| Longer-lived room persistence and audit replay | Durable Object or Worker-backed room owner |

### Planned Authenticated Chat Relay Boundary

The current production `airvio.co/__chat_proxy/*` Pages Function is a shared provider relay, not the collaboration trust boundary. True multi-user collaboration requires a server-owned auth and workspace-authorization layer that decides who may invoke server-managed providers and under which quota policy.

| Surface | Current state | Required production owner before acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| `__chat_proxy` Pages Function | Stateless provider relay with Cloudflare-held provider secrets | Keep as infrastructure-only relay; no browser-auth truth |
| Browser chat submit path | Can target a public proxy route | Move to authenticated `/api/chat/relay` server route |
| Workspace identity | Not implemented in shipped collaboration baseline | `users`, `auth_sessions`, `workspace_memberships` D1 schema plus auth middleware |
| Provider usage policy | Implicit/shared via Cloudflare secrets | `workspace_provider_policies` D1 owner plus focused policy tests |
| Relay audit and quota | Not implemented | `chat_proxy_audit` D1 owner plus bounded admin views |

#### Recommended Route Plan

| Method | Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/session` | Validate browser session cookie or token and resolve the active `userId` |
| GET | `/api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/membership` | Resolve the caller's workspace membership and role |
| GET | `/api/chat/policies/{workspaceId}` | Return provider capabilities and whether `serverManaged` or `byok` is allowed |
| POST | `/api/chat/relay` | Authenticate the caller, authorize workspace/provider access, enforce quota, append audit rows, then delegate internally to `__chat_proxy` |
| GET | `/api/chat/audit/{workspaceId}` | Return bounded relay audit entries for `owner` and `provider-admin` only |

#### Recommended D1 Owners

| Table | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `users` | Canonical user identity owner |
| `auth_sessions` | Revocable session owner; stores only hashed session material |
| `workspace_memberships` | Workspace membership and role owner |
| `workspace_provider_policies` | Per-workspace provider policy and quota owner |
| `chat_proxy_audit` | Relay audit, quota accounting, and operator diagnosis owner |

#### Migration Plan

1. Keep the current browser-native P2P collaboration pilot intact and preserve public BYOK experiments during the migration.
2. Introduce `users`, `auth_sessions`, `workspace_memberships`, `workspace_provider_policies`, and `chat_proxy_audit` in D1 with focused Worker ownership tests.
3. Add `/api/auth/session`, `/api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/membership`, and `/api/chat/policies/{workspaceId}` so the browser can resolve identity and provider capabilities before relay.
4. Add `/api/chat/relay` and make MainPanel chat submit call it whenever a workspace has authenticated collaboration enabled.
5. Restrict direct browser use of server-managed mode on `__chat_proxy`; keep `__chat_proxy` for server-internal delegation and explicit BYOK fallback only.
6. Add bounded owner/admin audit views before calling authenticated collaboration production-ready.

#### Acceptance Conditions For The Planned Extension

- Browser chat relay requests fail closed when the session is missing, expired, or not a member of the target workspace.
- `serverManaged` provider mode is impossible without an explicit `workspace_provider_policies` allow rule.
- Every server-managed chat relay writes one `chat_proxy_audit` row with `workspace_id`, `user_id`, `provider_id`, `auth_mode`, `relay_status`, and `latency_ms`.
- Collaboration UI shows workspace-scoped provider availability from `/api/chat/policies/{workspaceId}` instead of assuming a shared global proxy.
- `__chat_proxy` remains deployable as infrastructure-only relay code, but browser user flows no longer depend on it as the trust boundary.

## Deployment Strategy

This document is Dev-scoped. Do not deploy, publish to the Prod mirror, or push to Cloudflare until the user explicitly requests it. Runtime validation stays local through focused unit tests, docs guards, TypeScript, and the app-level E2E smoke command.

## Continuation

Technical architecture continues in [knowgrph-multi-user-collaboration-prd.tad.companion.md](knowgrph-multi-user-collaboration-prd.tad.companion.md).

## Goal Conditions

| Goal | Command or Evidence | Passing Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Collaboration readiness gate stays green | `npm run collaboration:readiness:check` | docs guard, focused collaboration/unit suites, and authenticated browser smoke all pass |
| Docs match shipped owners | `npm --prefix canvas run test:ci:unit -- "multiUserCollaboration.docs"` | 1/1 docs guard passes |
| Collaboration behavior remains intact | `npm --prefix canvas run test:ci:unit -- "collaboration."` | protocol, store, UI, and runtime tests pass |
| MainPanel UI remains stable | `npm --prefix canvas run test:ci:unit -- "ui.mainPanel.collaboration"` | roster, owner removal, and action registration tests pass |
| App-level authenticated room flow works | `npm --prefix canvas run validate:multi-user-collaboration:e2e` against the local owner app, guest app, and storage worker | The shared editor-workspace query route mounts the Markdown runtime on both pages, Collaboration opens, both peers reach `Workspace room connected`, a guest-side marker is applied to `docs/workspace-readme.md`, and the owner receives the same marker |
| Type contracts remain valid | `npm --prefix canvas exec tsc -- -p canvas/tsconfig.json --noEmit --pretty false` | TypeScript exits 0 |

## Open Questions

| Question | Decision Needed Before Expansion |
|---|---|
| What identity model should authenticated collaboration use? | Source-owned auth middleware, role schema, and tests |
| Should server rooms preserve offline state or only coordinate live peers? | Durable room TAD with explicit persistence and TCO |
| How should multi-document conflicts be surfaced? | Workspace merge UX and CRDT-backed document contract |
