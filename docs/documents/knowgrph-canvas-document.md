## Agentic GraphRAG/Knowledge Graph Pipeline Guidelines

Canonical guidelines: [knowgrph-pipeline-document.md](file:///Users/huijoohwee/Documents/GitHub/knowgrph/docs/documents/knowgrph-pipeline-document.md) and [AgenticRAG README.md](file:///Users/huijoohwee/Documents/GitHub/huijoohwee.github.io/schema/AgenticRAG/README.md).

## Design Mantras

```
- [ ] Configuration; externalize behavior via schema; forbid embedded constants
- [ ] Determinism; cache by viewKey and layout key; forbid cross-mode contamination
- [ ] Fit; apply aspect ratio and fill policies; forbid viewport-specific assumptions
- [ ] Locality; keep layout logic modular; forbid sprawling responsibilities
- [ ] Neutrality; operate on any graph; forbid dataset-tied behavior
- [ ] Non-Overlap; enforce node and group bbox collision; forbid visual intersections
- [ ] Observability; keep options discoverable; forbid undocumented defaults
```

## Universal Design Principles

| Context | Intent | Directive |
|---|---|---|
| Anti-Line Force | Break long linear concentrations | - [ ] Apply perpendicular jitter to linear clusters; forbid long unbalanced concentrations |
| Aspect Ratio | Prevent inconsistent fit behavior across viewports | - [ ] Fit via `schema.layout.fitTargetAspectRatio` (default 16:9); forbid hardcoded viewport assumptions |
| Centering | Keep zoom and fit stable across intents | - [ ] Center by centroid for all zoom/fit intents; forbid skew from bounding box bias |
| Clusters | Avoid distortion from distant outliers | - [ ] Filter outliers when fitting (`schema.layout.fitDetectClusters`); forbid distortion from distant nodes |
| Cross-mode Cache | Prevent layout drift when switching modes | - [ ] Key layout caches by `semanticMode + frontmatterMode + layoutMode + renderMode`; forbid cross-mode contamination |
| Documentation | Keep behavior discoverable and auditable | - [ ] Keep schema options discoverable; forbid undocumented behaviors or hidden defaults |
| Fit Frame | Prevent over-zoom on large viewports | - [ ] Compute fit scale on capped `1920×1080` (16:9) frame; forbid 4k/ultrawide over-zoom |
| Fit-to-Screen | Keep fit consistent with UI chrome changes | - [ ] Enforce 80/20 fill ratio via `targetFillRatio = 0.8`; forbid inconsistent viewport fill |
| Integration | Keep parsing, schema, and rendering aligned | - [ ] Use schema-driven fit and Mermaid layout paths; forbid bypass of configuration flow |
| Keyword Mode | Make text-derived graph views tunable and portable | - [ ] Derive keyword nodes/edges from document text; remove stopwords; map frequency/strength to sizes with schema tunables; preserve overlays; forbid stopword noise and selection-only dashboards |
| Padding | Avoid clipped nodes and labels | - [ ] Apply `fitPadding` and node padding; forbid edge clipping or truncation |
| Port Handles | Keep edge routing explicit and configurable | - [ ] Route 2D edge endpoints via `schema.behavior.portHandles.*`; forbid interference with tree or Mermaid layouts |
| Rectangular Nodes | Keep node sizing stable across layout modes | - [ ] Size via minimap-relative defaults (tree and port handles); forbid drift across layouts |
| Scaling | Keep zoom limits safe and predictable | - [ ] Clamp zoom scale via `schema.performance.zoom.{minScale,maxScale}`; forbid hardcoded scale extents |
| Schema | Centralize layout and sizing policies | - [ ] Route layout and label sizing through `schema.layout.*`; forbid embedded constants or dataset ties |
| Subgraph Containment | Prevent nodes escaping group bounds | - [ ] Clamp member nodes within group bounds; forbid escape or touching borders |
| Verification | Make layout and fit changes regression-resistant | - [ ] Cover fit and layout behaviors via bounded tests; forbid brittle dataset-specific assertions |
| Zoom State | Prevent stale transforms across view toggles | - [ ] Cache zoom state by viewKey across mode/layout/presentation toggles; forbid stale transforms when switching layers/modes/labels/groups |

## Repository Architecture

**Module Hierarchy**: schema defaults/types → layout engines (force/radial/stratify/Mermaid) → collision + overlap resolution → fit + zoom controller → renderer layers (nodes/links/groups)  

**Dependency Flow**: schema/config readers → positioning/caching → simulation/constraints → scene composition → zoom state persistence

### High-Level Components

- Graph canvas host:
  - `canvas/src/components/GraphCanvas/*` orchestrates layout, zoom, scene layers, and caching.
- Layout engines:
  - `canvas/src/components/GraphCanvas/layout/*` implements force/radial/stratify layout pipelines and shared helpers.
- Overlap resolution:
  - `canvas/src/components/GraphCanvas/layout/{overlap.ts,groupOverlap.ts,relax.ts}` centralize bbox collision and bounded relaxation.
- Fit and zoom:
  - `canvas/src/components/GraphCanvas/{fit.ts,zoom.ts,zoomState.ts,zoomController.ts}` centralize zoom policies and per-view caching.
- Shared presets:
  - `grph-shared/src/zoom/presets.ts` provides reusable fit/zoom presets (capped 16:9 frame + fill ratio) reused by fit logic and simulation/layout seeding.

## Module Specification

### Module: `GraphCanvas` fit + zoom policy

**Goal**: provide stable Fit-to-Screen/Fit-to-Selection behavior across view toggles and layout modes.

| Context | Intent | Directive | Module | Function/Method | Input | Output | Decision Logic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fit mapping | Keep fit consistent across viewports | - [ ] Fit on capped `1920×1080` frame and `targetFillRatio = 0.8`; forbid viewport-dependent over-zoom | GraphCanvas | fitAllTransform | viewport, schema | transform | Use aspect-ratio frame then scale by fill ratio |
| Zoom centering | Prevent drift between fit and user zoom | - [ ] Scale centered on graph centroid; forbid bbox-bias centering | GraphCanvas | scaleCenteredOnGraphCentroidTransform | centroid, scale | transform | Always compute centroid from rendered nodes |
| Zoom state | Avoid stale transforms when switching views | - [ ] Cache zoom state per viewKey; forbid cross-mode reuse | GraphCanvas | setZoomStateForKey | viewKey, zoomState | persisted state | viewKey includes presentation toggles |

### Module: collision + overlap SSOT

**Goal**: ensure no node/group overlap and keep collision knobs schema-driven.

| Context | Intent | Directive | Module | Function/Method | Input | Output | Decision Logic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Collision config | Centralize tunables | - [ ] Read bbox collision settings from schema; forbid ad-hoc constants | layout | readCollisionConfig | schema.layout | config | Single config reader used by all modes |
| Group overlap | Prevent group bbox intersections | - [ ] Enforce group bbox collision whenever groups enabled; forbid disabling via legacy knobs | layout | createGroupBboxCollideForce | schema.layout.groups | force | Group membership derived from rendered group key |
