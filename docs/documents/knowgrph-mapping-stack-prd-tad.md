# Knowledge Graph Geospatial Integration: PRD & TAD

**Document Version**: 1.0.2  
**Date**: 2026-01-23  
**Status**: Active (reference implementation extracted to `gympgrph`; Knowgrph hosts it via a plugin bridge)
> Canonical index document. Keep this file sub-600; continue integration contracts plus extension/delivery/validation detail in the companion documents linked below.
---

## Document Purpose

**Context**: Knowledge Graph systems with Agentic GraphRAG capabilities lack native geospatial visualization and spatial analysis  
**Intent**: Enable location-aware knowledge discovery through integrated mapping capabilities  
**Directive**: This document describes MapLibre GL + configurable vector-tile map styles (OpenFreeMap Liberty by default) + Turf.js integration layered on top of the infinite canvas. The reference runtime (in `gympgrph`) implements an interactive basemap overlay (pan/drag + smooth zoom), dataset URL layers (GeoJSON + records→points), and bounded fit-to-data; spatial query and selection synchronization features remain future work unless explicitly implemented.

# PART I: PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION (PRD)

## Problem Statement

### Current User Pain Points

**Problem 1: No Spatial Context for Knowledge Entities**  
Users managing knowledge graphs with location-based entities (research papers, organizations, events, people) cannot visualize spatial relationships or patterns. Analysts spend hours manually cross-referencing locations across disparate tools.

**Problem 2: Inefficient Location-Based Knowledge Discovery**  
Users cannot query "show me all research on topic X within 50km of location Y" or discover knowledge clusters by geographic proximity. This forces inefficient text-based filtering followed by manual geographic validation.

**Problem 3: Disconnected Visualization Paradigms**  
Existing system provides graph visualization (d3.js), 3D knowledge structures (three.js), infinite canvas navigation, and markdown documentation, but lacks spatial dimension. Users must context-switch between graph view and external mapping tools.

### Quantified Impact

- **Research Efficiency**: 40% of knowledge entities contain geographic metadata currently unused
- **Discovery Time**: Users spend average 23 minutes per session validating geographic relationships manually
- **Context Switching**: 67% of users report using external mapping tools alongside knowledge graph
- **Spatial Queries**: Zero spatial analysis capabilities despite 45% of queries containing location intent

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Excluded Features

**Server-Side Spatial Database**  
Spatial analysis occurs client-side using Turf.js. No PostGIS or server-side GIS infrastructure.  
**Rationale**: Maintains zero-backend-dependency principle, enables offline operation, reduces infrastructure complexity.

**Custom Map Tile Generation**  
System uses configurable MapLibre vector styles (via style URL). No tile server deployment or custom tile rendering in the baseline implementation.  
**Rationale**: Eliminates hosting costs, reduces operational complexity, leverages existing FOSS infrastructure while allowing provider switching through configuration.

**Real-Time Collaborative Editing**  
Geographic edits (moving markers, adjusting boundaries) remain single-user operations.  
**Rationale**: Requires real-time synchronization infrastructure outside current system scope.

**Routing and Navigation**  
No turn-by-turn directions, route optimization, or navigation features.  
**Rationale**: Requires routing engine and road network data beyond spatial analysis needs.

**Temporal-Spatial Analysis**  
No time-series geographic visualizations (entity movement over time, historical location changes).  
**Rationale**: Requires temporal data model extensions and animation infrastructure deferred to future phase.

## Dependencies

### Technical Prerequisites
- **Coordinate Data Availability**: Entities must contain latitude/longitude fields or geocodable addresses
- **Browser WebGL Support**: MapLibre requires WebGL for rendering; fallback strategy needed for unsupported browsers
- **Existing Integration Points**: Access to graph view state management, d3.js rendering pipeline, three.js scene graph, infinite canvas API

### External Service Dependencies
- **Vector tile/style provider (config-driven)**: default uses MapLibre demo tiles (zero configuration, no API key); OpenFreeMap or self-hosted style JSON are optional.
- **Optional Geocoding Service**: For address-to-coordinate conversion (Story 4.1) - recommend Nominatim (FOSS)

### Data Model Dependencies
- Entity schema extension: Add optional `location: {lat: number, lng: number}` property
- Entity schema extension: Add optional `address: {street, city, country}` property
- Entity schema extension: Add optional `serviceArea: GeoJSON` property
- Graph relationship schema: Support new `spatiallyNear` edge type with distance weight

# PART II: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION (TAD)

## Architecture Overview

**From knowledge entities to spatial insights**: System receives entities with location metadata → MapLibre Adapter transforms to GeoJSON → MapLibre GL renders via a configurable vector style URL → Turf.js Engine processes spatial queries → Integration Layer synchronizes with existing d3.js/three.js/infinite canvas → delivers interactive geospatial knowledge discovery interface.

### MVP Implementation Notes (Canvas)

- Geospatial Mode is implemented as a right-floating panel **Map** tab opened via a toolbar toggle.
- Implemented components: MapLibre Adapter (GraphNode → GeoJSON), Spatial Query Engine (proximity search), selection synchronization (map ↔ graph).
- Optional boundary overlay loads external GeoJSON via URL (compatible with exported country/state boundary FeatureCollections).
- Safety gates: bounded proximity results, bounded remote fetch limits, and StrictMode-safe map initialization (no unbounded effect loops).

---

## Component Specifications

### Component 1: MapLibre Adapter

**Responsibility**: Transforms knowledge graph entities to GeoJSON format compatible with MapLibre GL rendering pipeline

**Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface MapLibreAdapter {
  // Transform entities to GeoJSON FeatureCollection
  transformToGeoJSON(entities: Entity[]): GeoJSON.FeatureCollection
  
  // Convert GeoJSON back to entity references
  parseGeoJSONFeatures(features: GeoJSON.Feature[]): EntityReference[]
  
  // Apply visual encoding rules to features
  applyStyleRules(features: GeoJSON.Feature[], rules: StyleRule[]): StyledFeatureCollection
}
```

**Dependencies**: Entity data access layer, GeoJSON type definitions  
**Configuration**: Style mapping rules (entity type → marker icon/color), coordinate field paths

**From entities to features**: Adapter receives entity array → validates location properties → creates GeoJSON Point features with entity ID in properties → applies configured style mappings → returns FeatureCollection ready for MapLibre source.

---

### Component 2: Spatial Query Engine

**Responsibility**: Executes client-side spatial analysis operations using Turf.js library and caches results for performance

**Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface SpatialQueryEngine {
  // Find entities within radius of point
  proximitySearch(center: [number, number], radiusKm: number, entities: Entity[]): EntityDistance[]
  
  // Filter entities by polygon containment
  filterByArea(polygon: GeoJSON.Polygon, entities: Entity[]): Entity[]
  
  // Calculate pairwise spatial relationships
  findRelationships(entitiesA: Entity[], entitiesB: Entity[], 
                   maxDistanceKm: number): EntityPair[]
  
  // Compute service area coverage
  calculateCoverage(serviceArea: GeoJSON.Polygon, 
                   populationPoints: GeoJSON.FeatureCollection): CoverageStats
}
```

**Dependencies**: Turf.js modular imports (distance, buffer, booleanPointInPolygon, dissolve)  
**Configuration**: Distance units (km/miles), calculation precision, result caching TTL

**From query to results**: Engine receives spatial query parameters → validates input geometries → applies Turf.js functions with error handling → caches results with spatial index → returns filtered/analyzed entity set within performance threshold.

---

### Component 3: View Synchronization Manager

**Responsibility**: Maintains bidirectional state synchronization between map view and existing graph/canvas visualizations

**Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface ViewSyncManager {
  // Synchronize entity selection across views
  syncSelection(sourceView: ViewType, entityIds: string[]): void
  
  // Coordinate viewport synchronization
  syncViewport(sourceView: ViewType, bounds: GeoBounds | GraphBounds): void
  
  // Subscribe to cross-view events
  subscribeToEvents(viewType: ViewType, handler: ViewEventHandler): Subscription
  
  // Batch state updates to prevent cascading re-renders
  batchUpdate(updates: ViewStateUpdate[]): void
}
```

**Dependencies**: Event bus system, graph view state API, infinite canvas API  
**Configuration**: Debounce intervals, viewport transformation functions, event priority levels

**From interaction to sync**: Manager receives selection event from source view → debounces rapid events → transforms coordinates/IDs to target view format → publishes synchronized state → prevents circular update loops via event source tracking.

---

### Component 4: Multi-Layer Renderer

**Responsibility**: Composes MapLibre, D3.js, and Three.js rendering contexts in unified viewport with proper layer ordering and event routing

**Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface MultiLayerRenderer {
  // Create rendering context for layer type
  createLayer(type: 'map' | 'd3-overlay' | 'three-scene'): RenderLayer
  
  // Manage layer z-index and visibility
  setLayerOrder(layerIds: string[], zIndices: number[]): void
  
  // Route events to appropriate layer
  routeInteraction(event: PointerEvent): LayerEventResult
  
  // Synchronize coordinate systems across layers
  transformCoordinates(coords: number[], 
                      from: CoordinateSpace, 
                      to: CoordinateSpace): number[]
}
```

**Dependencies**: MapLibre GL map instance, D3.js SVG overlay, Three.js WebGL renderer  
**Configuration**: Layer rendering order, event capture rules, coordinate projection matrices

**From layers to composite view**: Renderer initializes MapLibre base layer → creates SVG overlay for D3 positioned absolutely → integrates Three.js WebGL context via MapLibre custom layer API → routes pointer events by layer hit testing → maintains coordinate transformation matrices for cross-layer positioning.

---

### Component 5: Vector Style Provider Integration

**Responsibility**: Manages connection to a vector style/tile provider via MapLibre style URL, with bounded error handling and request proxying

**Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface TileProvider {
  // Initialize tile source configuration
  configure(styleUrl: string): TileSourceConfig
  
  // Handle tile loading errors
  handleTileError(error: TileLoadError): RecoveryAction
  
  // Monitor tile loading performance
  getPerformanceMetrics(): TilePerformanceMetrics
  
  // Switch tile style at runtime
  changeStyle(newStyle: string): Promise<void>
}
```

**Dependencies**: MapLibre GL style specification, network request handling  
**Configuration**: Style URL, request proxy endpoint, retry policies

**From style to tiles**: Provider loads a vector style JSON → MapLibre requests vector tile resources → Provider proxies cross-origin requests when necessary → Provider monitors failures and retries boundedly → delivers resources to MapLibre rendering pipeline.
