# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines requirements for generating `docs/documents/knowgrph-api-reference/knowgrph-videodb-api-reference.md` — a **spec-complete, runtime-ready** static SSOT + codebase map reference for knowgrph's VideoDB integration slot in the `MainPanel Integrations` surface.

VideoDB (base URL: `https://api.videodb.io`, auth: `x-access-token` header) provides collections, video CRUD, streaming, transcription, semantic/keyword search over spoken-word and scene indexes, AI generation (video, audio, image, text, dub, translate), timeline compilation, async operation polling, RTStream, downloads, and utility endpoints. The TypeScript SSOT file exists at `canvas/src/features/integrations/videodbSsot.ts` for MainPanel Integrations runtime rendering; the CLI generator remains planned.

The spec also covers the runnable Dev demo at `$GITHUB_ROOT/huijoohwee/docs/knowgrph-strybldr-demo.md`. This consolidated Strybldr demo is the local documentation/demo artifact for VideoDB. It SHALL NOT imply a Prod publish, Cloudflare deploy, or live route claim until the operator explicitly authorizes deployment.

The document must:
- Follow the exact `key | type | value | key-description | value-description | ssot | module | class | function` table format used by `knowgrph-grabmaps-api-reference.md` and `knowgrph-byteplus-openark-video-generation-api-reference.md`
- Include a YAML frontmatter block (required per PRD/TAD guidelines) and a knowgrph VideoDB Integration Overlay section (following the Stripe overlay pattern)
- Be emittable by a planned CLI generator (`canvas/src/cli/generate-videodb-reference.ts`) from the SSOT TS file (`canvas/src/features/integrations/videodbSsot.ts`)
- Cover every VideoDB API surface area relevant to the knowgrph `MainPanel Integrations` tab
- Forbid hardcoded runtime values (API keys, collection IDs, video IDs); all such values are operator-supplied settings
- Note async vs synchronous operation semantics and pipeline correctness properties

---

## Glossary

- **VideoDB**: The video intelligence cloud provider at `https://api.videodb.io` offering collections, video storage, indexing, semantic search, streaming, and AI generation capabilities.
- **SSOT**: Single Source of Truth. In knowgrph, a TypeScript file under `canvas/src/features/integrations/` that exports typed `DOC_ROWS` arrays consumed by runtime panels and CLI doc generators.
- **Runtime SSOT**: A TS SSOT file that exists in the codebase and owns the rows consumed by the runtime surface.
- **DOC_ROW**: A typed object in an integration SSOT that maps one `key` to its `type`, `value`, `keyDescription`, `valueDescription`, `ssot`, `module`, `className`, and `functionName`.
- **MainPanel Integrations**: The `integrations` tab (key: `integrations`) in knowgrph's MainPanel. Description: "Configure model, media, provider, and API readiness rows."
- **SettingsView**: The React component (`canvas/src/features/panels/views/SettingsView.tsx`) that renders integration rows in the MainPanel.
- **useSettingsView**: The hook (`canvas/src/features/panels/views/useSettingsView.ts`) that wires settings rows to the SettingsView renderer.
- **StoryboardWidget_Manager**: The widget registry manager (`canvas/src/features/storyboard-widget-manager/`) that consumes SSOT rows to populate NodeOverlayEditor and Workflow Manager widget fields.
- **VideodbSsot**: The TypeScript SSOT file at `canvas/src/features/integrations/videodbSsot.ts`.
- **CLI_Generator**: The planned generator script at `canvas/src/cli/generate-videodb-reference.ts` that emits the static markdown doc from the SSOT.
- **x-access-token**: The VideoDB authentication header. Operator-supplied value; must never be hardcoded in the repository.
- **Collection**: A VideoDB container grouping videos, audios, and images. Identified by a `collection_id` string.
- **Async_Operation**: A VideoDB operation that returns a job/task id and requires polling `GET /async-response/{id}` until `status` reaches a terminal state (`completed` or `failed`).
- **RTStream**: VideoDB's real-time streaming feature supporting create, start/stop, export, transcription, scene indexing, and event/alert operations.
- **VideoDB Configuration Reference Table**: The primary `key | type | value | ...` markdown table in the generated document.

3. THE Section SHALL state the stream URL validity property: after a successful `POST /video/{id}/stream/` call, the returned stream URL SHALL be a non-empty string beginning with `https://` or `http://`.
4. THE Section SHALL state the transcription round-trip property: `GET /video/{id}/transcription` after the corresponding `POST /video/{id}/transcription` async operation reaches terminal state SHALL return a transcription object whose text content is non-empty for any video with audible speech.
5. THE Section SHALL state the async polling termination property: all async operations polled via `GET /async-response/{id}` SHALL reach `completed` or `failed` status within 36 poll iterations at 10-second intervals; polling SHALL terminate at the bound and return a failure result rather than looping indefinitely.
6. THE Section SHALL classify each property as either "suitable for property-based testing with mocked HTTP layer" or "requires live VideoDB API (integration test)".
7. WHERE a property is classified as suitable for property-based testing, THE Section SHALL note that the VideoDB HTTP layer must be mocked to keep tests cost-free.

2. THE Table rows SHALL be sorted a-z by `key` across the entire table (not grouped by API section).
3. FOR ALL rows, THE `ssot` cell SHALL contain a `::` separator followed by a non-empty section label referencing the relevant section of the VideoDB API docs.
4. FOR ALL rows, THE `module` cell SHALL reference `canvas/src/features/integrations/videodbSsot.ts` as the primary runtime module.

2. THE demo SHALL declare `demo_status` as a Dev/runtime-slot demo and SHALL set `deployed_api_claim` to `false`.
3. THE demo SHALL include flow nodes for `knowgrph.content_brief`, `videodb.health`, `videodb.collection.list`, `videodb.ai.generate_video`, `videodb.async_response.get`, `videodb.index.spoken_word`, `videodb.video.search`, `videodb.video.stream`, and `knowgrph.publish_packet`.
4. THE demo SHALL include the exact endpoint templates `POST /video/{id}/generate/video`, `POST /video/{id}/index/`, `POST /video/{id}/search/`, and `POST /video/{id}/stream/`.
5. THE demo SHALL keep `api_key`, `collection_id`, `generation_job_id`, `video_id`, `index_job_id`, `stream_url`, `download_url`, and `publish_packet_path` blank by default and SHALL state that these values are operator-supplied or returned by live VideoDB calls at runtime.
6. THE demo SHALL NOT fabricate collection IDs, job IDs, video IDs, or stream URLs with hardcoded prefixes, default identifiers, or mock URL hosts.
7. THE demo SHALL document the async circuit-breaker as 36 iterations at 10-second intervals and SHALL state that polling returns failure instead of looping indefinitely on exhaustion.
8. THE demo SHALL NOT assert Prod or Cloudflare availability and SHALL NOT require deployment to `airvio.co` or `airvio.co/knowgrph`.
9. THE demo SHALL declare renderer compatibility for `2D Renderer: Storyboard` and `2D Renderer: Strybldr` without forking source data per renderer.
10. THE demo SHALL include Storyboard-compatible neutral aliases on `flow.nodes[*]` and a parseable `json strybldr-storyboard` fenced payload for Strybldr direct-open validation.
11. THE demo SHALL use a knowgrph-native workflow and SHALL NOT contain copied external workflow-platform or external notes-database terms from the inspiration document.
